Speaker 7: Thank you. Let's go ahead with the staff report.
Speaker 4: Ms.. Martinson will make the presentation of staff presentation on this item as well.
Speaker 6: Again. Good evening, mayor and members of city council. Before you tonight as an application for entertainment without dancing for El Barrio Neighborhood Bar LLC, DBA El Barrio Cantina, which is located at 1731 East Fourth Street. This establishment operates as a restaurant bar. The business has valid ABC license as follows Type 47 on sale, general eating place and Type 58 Catering per caterer. Permit these license. Authorize the sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits for consumption on the licensed premises. Among other things, the business met the Long Beach Municipal Code requirements to be eligible for a temporary entertainment permit and was issued one in November of 2021. All of the appropriate departments, Health and Human Services, Development Services, Police, Financial Management and Financial Management have reviewed the application and have provided their recommended conditions as contained in the hearing packet. The following recommended conditions on attachment A are of note from section two of the additional conditions. Section number one in that section is entertainment activities shall be restricted to no later than 11 p.m., Monday through Thursday and midnight Friday through Sunday. Entertainment can begin at 12 noon daily. The business applied, requesting entertainment to be permitted from nine or 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. seven days a week. And the Long Beach Police Department recommended the restricted conditions to balance community concerns and the businesses needs. Section number six or item number six. The committee has been requested to develop and maintain a plan to address neighborhood concerns related to the operation of the business. In addition, the Department of Financial Management is requesting a change to the enclosed conditions Section one. Item four, with the removal of the last sentence of the first paragraph. Hours of sales. Hours of sales of alcohol shall be limited to the hours when meals are available. In this particular situation, this condition was found to be too restricted after additional consideration of the communications from the business owner. Although this does not remove the requirement to continue to operate a bona fide restaurant. I, along with the Miami-Dade Police Department, as well as Art Sanchez, deputy city attorney, are available to answer any questions that you may have. This concludes my staff report.
Speaker 7: Thank you. Let's go to public comment there. Any public comment on number 23?
Speaker 4: Chou Lin.
Speaker 1: Julian, please approach the podium.
Speaker 2: Um, I, everyone actually submitted on that. And when the owner of the business, I didn't know I was not supposed to submit the comment. So I just wanted to, I just didn't know I was supposed to pretend that I needed to come or not. But here I am. Um, so I don't really have any comments to this other than I'm for it since I'm a business owner. Um, and you guys are welcome to dine at the restaurant anytime.
Speaker 7: Thank you. Tastic. Thank you. All right, back behind the rail, councilman Alan Atherton.
Speaker 6: Thank you, Vice Mayor. Also. Thank you, Joe, for for coming out. It's great to great to see you. I just want to say that the Fourth Street and the Retro Row is one of the highlights of the second district. The bid and all the businesses there do a great job managing the area. And I know Al Barrio is a very popular a spot and Joe and Jesse have done a fantastic job with the property. If you haven't been there, the food is excellent. It's great ambiance and just a big upgrade on Fourth Street. So I support this entertainment permit. I do understand that some folks have some concerns about noise or congregating, you know, out there from the business. So we just ask that you kindly keep an eye on that for all of our neighbors. And I just want to say that El Barrio is just a welcome addition to our fourth Street restaurant community. And I know that that Joe, you and Jesse are great operators and that you'll comply with all the conditions listed and make every effort just to be a good neighbor. So thank you.
Speaker 7: All right. Thank you. It's been moved in. Seconded members, please cast your vote.

LongBeachCC_05102022_22-0507,"Speaker 0: Thank you very much. We do have one hearing, so let's go ahead and begin that hearing, please. It's on the master fee schedule.
Speaker 2: Report from Financial Management Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution amending the master fee and charges schedule citywide.
Speaker 0: Thank you. There's a motion any second on this already. Let me turn this over to Mr. Modica.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We can give a short staff report from Grace Yoon, our budget manager.
Speaker 8: Great. Thank you, Tom. Good evening, Mayor. And members of the City Council. City Council's approval is being requested to amend the Fy22 master fees and charges schedule. This is something that's updated citywide at least twice a year to allow departments to meet City Council's stated policy on user fees, which calls for full.
Speaker 2: Cost recovery whenever appropriate.
Speaker 8: City Council last approved an amended master fees and charges schedule on September 7th as part of the Fy22 budget adoption. So this report, the changes to the master fees and charges schedule includes adjustments across six departments, with changes based on the completed cost of service study.
Speaker 2: For Energy Resources and Public Works.
Speaker 8: Department, which were presented to City Council on February 1st of this year. In addition to those changes related to the cost of services study, proposed fee changes also include other department fee recommendations necessary for administrative and operational purposes.
Speaker 2: So that concludes my report.
Speaker 8: And Department Representative representatives are available to answer any specific questions you may have on proposed changes.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Do we have a public comment and we'll come back to the diets, please.
Speaker 2: There's one public comment. Dave Shukla. Dave Shukla. He's not in the audience.
Speaker 0: I don't see public comment. We to go and go back to the dais. Councilman Mongo.
Speaker 7: I just want to take a moment to recognize the staff at financial management. It has taken a long time for us to get to a place where we know and understand our fees in a meaningful way. I know it took many years. I do want to ask specifics on an animal control licensing fee for about four years now. We've been asking that all of the licenses get coordinated through a process where you would be able to pay a partial year to catch up so that all your animals can be renewed at once, saving the department hundreds of dollars a year, if not definitely be thousands by now considering postage rates. Instead of mailing my house three animal dog license renewals at three different months of the year. You'd save a dollar by putting them all together. This has been three years in the making and I've heard excuses of, Well, we don't have a fee that works for that or we can't prorate. Do we have any progress towards that? Do we need to add a fee to the schedule or do we need to make any annotation at this time that we'd like to be able to prorate and ensure that entering into the fiscal year of 2020. Three. No. Yes. 2023. That that would be policy.
Speaker 8: Yeah. We have our director.
Speaker 2: Of Parks, Recreation and Marine.
Speaker 8: Who can come up and talk on that. Parks, Recreation and Marine was part of the round one fee study for our citywide fee study. So that may have also been something that was looked at during that.
Speaker 7: And I apologize. I know that this started before our current Parks and Rec director. We appreciate you. And we know you picked up a lot of projects and this is a big priority and I'll make sure it's done before the next fiscal year.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I know Stacy Danes, who unfortunately is ill tonight, or she'd be able to probably answer this more specifically. But I know in our recent council briefing last month, we did discuss this in depth. And I know she is looking into that alignment, which makes a lot of sense. So we are working towards that. And I appreciate your bringing attention to this financial matter.
Speaker 7: Thank you. Mr. Monaco, do I have your assurances that this is something we can pursue before the next budget cycle? Or do I need to bring an agenda item?
Speaker 1: Sure, we'll work on it. I'll get this as an item you and I've talked about, and we're talking with the Parks and Rec director about what's the path forward and if you'll need to bring an item. If there's some other challenge that we need to tell you about, we will do that.
Speaker 7: Thank you. I appreciate it. I know it's a priority for animal lovers across the city and an opportunity for us to really find some cost savings and save the money for the department. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson, any comments?
Speaker 1: Okay. I'm good. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Okay. We have a motion in a second. Please cast your votes.
Speaker 2: Motion is carried."
LongBeachCC_02082022_22-0137,"Speaker 0: District nine. As motion is carried.
Speaker 2: Great. Thank you. And now we will hear item ten, please.
Speaker 0: Report from Police Department recommendation to authorize the city manager to receive and expend grant funding up to 368,000 for body worn camera policy and implementation program to support law enforcement agencies and increase appropriations in the General Fund and the General Grants Fund Group and the Police Department by 368,000, offset by grant revenue citywide.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I know Councilman Price for this item on Councilman Price.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I was hoping that we could get a brief staff report on this. Given the public safety committee back on the days push for this particular body worn camera policy. I just want to know exactly where the new body worn cameras are going to be deployed.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Yes, Councilmember, I will have the police department answer those questions.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember. The all of our body worn cameras, currently just about 630 are deployed in the field to patrol personnel in some of our special specialized units. The goal being full deployment for our entire staff. But currently, any public facing specialized unit and patrol personnel have body worn cameras.
Speaker 1: Okay. And are we still using evidence? Econ. Or you.
Speaker 2: Can guess we are evidence dot com is our storage platform.
Speaker 1: And we're still using the axon on cameras.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. At some point, I know it's probably not this particular item, but I would love a report back on what some of the costs have been. I know initially when we wanted to deploy. Body worn cameras. We talked a little bit about the cost of responding to praise and things of that nature. So, Chief, this will probably be a future item, which is for you to think about. Now that we've been using body worn cameras since 2016, I'd love to know what the costs, actual actual costs are as opposed to what we thought they would be in terms of the cost to the city. I think that's something that's worth a report back at some point.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman. We can definitely do that and put something together to bring back.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Will bring an item, but thank you, chief. I appreciate it.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I have, Councilman. I'm sorry. Council member Austin. And thank me the second. Yes. I think in the motion. And I support the request from the maker of the motion. Thank you. And and Councilwoman Allen.

LongBeachCC_08252020_20-0608,"Speaker 4: Communication from Council Member Pearce, Chair of Environmental Committee. Recommendation to request City Council to endorse the Climate Action Adaptation Plan. Consider the Community Choice Aggregation Initiative and include a construction career policy with the Climate Action Adaptation Plan.
Speaker 0: Councilmember Pearce.
Speaker 2: Yes. I'd like to make a motion to move this item to another time for re agenda.
Speaker 0: Change there a second.
Speaker 2: Look.
Speaker 0: Is there a second queue up on the factory? Thank you. Okay. There's a second there's a public comment on this item to move it.
Speaker 4: There is public comment on this item.
Speaker 5: Our first speaker is Gabrielle Weekes.
Speaker 2: Choice Aggregate has worked very well.
Speaker 3: For the 30 some odd cities.
Speaker 2: I believe it's 34 that have been using it.
Speaker 3: With CPA and then Lancaster as its own.
Speaker 2: Standalone, and they've been.
Speaker 3: Doing that successfully for years. Take a look at these things. Do their due diligence. It's working in industrial as.
Speaker 2: Well as suburban areas, and it's preposterous.
Speaker 3: To pretend that it's not successful. If we wish to just.
Speaker 2: Deliver more money out of loyalty.
Speaker 3: Let's just admit that.
Speaker 5: Thank you. Our next speaker is Adeline Yoon. Adeline, you.
Speaker 2: Hi. Good afternoon. Good evening, Mayor, vice mayor and council members. My name is widely known and I'm a government relations manager with Southern California Edison. In light of the fact that this is going to be pushed off, I will hold off on my comment. Thank you very much.
Speaker 5: Our next speaker is Kobe Sky.
Speaker 3: Thank you. Given that this item is being moved, I will provide additional comments when it's brought back. But I do hope that the Council recognizes the connection between the Climate Action Plan and the serious climate impacts that we're already facing as a region, and the need to have more flexibility and really control over our own future direction by considering it in, because it really is a critical step in our climate goals, in our environmental goals. Thank you.
Speaker 5: Thank you. Our next speaker is Stella. Ursula.
Speaker 2: Hello. I will hold off on my comments until the item.
Speaker 3: Is brought back to a an.
Speaker 2: Upcoming meeting. Thank you.
Speaker 5: Our next speaker is Maryanne Buchanan.
Speaker 2: I see the council and a mayor. So I am going to talk about this because I'll talk about it when it comes up later, too. But we're talking about two environmental things on this item, a climate action plan. And second, whether we should enter into a community choice energy program. But I suggest we are dealing with a third initiative here, and that is the racial equity and reconciliation report, that report on race in Long Beach. That third thing urges you to address both the other two planned, namely to advance environmental and racial justice by supporting the Climate Action Plan and to explore renewable energy resources. These two environmental plans are nested in that third report on race. We just cannot deal with either of the climate related two without looking through the racial lens of the third, because those three plans have one goal a healthy and happy life for all of us who live and work in Long Beach. Our neighbors are hurting. They are getting sick and dying. And we look to your leadership and compassion to put this right. Thank you. I yield my time.
Speaker 5: Thank you. Our last speaker is Tiffany Davey.
Speaker 2: Hi. Good evening. I'm going to.
Speaker 3: Take this opportunity. To just up the list. Again, the fact that we're in a pandemic mixed with a public health crisis.
Speaker 2: And encouraged in this.
Speaker 3: Time between the items brought back to the Council.
Speaker 2: For us to look.
Speaker 3: At the Council on Foreign Relations report titled Impact of Climate Risk on the Energy System is imperative to understand. For every dollar you spend.
Speaker 2: Now for.
Speaker 3: Mitigation efforts, you save six. So what will cost you $1.6 million to implement? Without doing that, you are raising your cost at least six times that of the. Council convened in March of 2019 for a two day workshop where they essentially spoke about. How are these climate related events separate from just the racial equity aspect, which we are all giving a considerable amount of time to.
Speaker 2: Create risk to the US energy.
Speaker 3: Infrastructure, financial markets and national security. We don't have really a full scope on how to manage and mitigate the future catastrophes that I mean, if we look, we've already kind of taken some damage and lost a part of our peer a number of years ago during a storm. We must think, especially as we're getting ready to deliberate on the oil.
Speaker 2: Wells that are abandoned.
Speaker 3: Coming up on the 27th of Mission Development Services set to be considered. Thank you.
Speaker 5: Thank you. And that concludes public comment for this item. Okay.
Speaker 0: Let's go ahead and take the vote, please. This moves in District one.
Speaker 2: I.
Speaker 4: District two.
Speaker 2: And District three. I.
Speaker 4: District four.
Speaker 5: AI.
Speaker 4: District five AI District six by District seven. By District eight. District nine. All right. Motion carries.

Speaker 4: Yes, we have the public comment. Speaker's waiting."
LongBeachCC_08112020_20-0678,"Speaker 0: Motion carries as you please. Item 19.
Speaker 2: Communication from Councilwoman Pryce, Chair, Public Safety Committee Recommendation or request staff to explore revisiting the fire facility's impact fee ordinance and evaluate other financing solutions that are available.
Speaker 0: Councilwoman Price.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. This is this is an item that came before public safety. And we requested a report actually a very long time ago on our current fire impact fees and how those fees are utilized and how much money is a revenue is collected through those fees. In light of the recommendations or the presentation that was made by the fire department, it became apparent to all of us that we need to reassess our fire impact fees and look at alternative methods of funding fire facilities moving forward. Because we don't have really a long term way of preparing for infrastructure needs and building new facilities within the fire department. And as we start to see more density and growth throughout the city, we should be reevaluating whether our fire impact fees, our development fees that include impacts to city infrastructure are appropriate in light of our need . So this item is asking the city manager to evaluate its different financing or funding options, including creative approaches to create revenue creation for fire facilities and a report back to council with options.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Price. Do every fiber come into the center?
Speaker 4: Yes, we have the issue. Your time starts now.
Speaker 0: Hello again. I'd like to. I'd like you all to strongly consider this item very carefully, very important. There are a lot of funding options from the case study. Clearly, our. Fire and destruction needs to be modernized and updated to reflect the needs of the city. Getting new locations is good. Getting back to planning for how to most effectively meet our needs. The construction and furnishing of new buildings defined by the services. I mean, that's a tremendous opportunity not just to work with storage, but I mean, you know, just a community resource. I mean, there's so many things that can be done when people have to defund the police. I mean, $10 million a week, $10 million for some of these properties. I mean, item to get, you know, the purchase of the property which which is a good thing to land is the most important after the city. But how we optimize and utilize that, how we prepare for emergency services and potentiality, that is very, very important. I very much appreciate the councilwoman for bringing forth. Thank you. Any room comfortable in my purse, would you? Actually.
Speaker 1: I guess I'll second this motion. There's not already a second.
Speaker 0: And also we only have a second.
Speaker 1: Okay. I support this item, and I wanted to speak to it just because in the downtown, obviously we've had a lot of development with the downtown plan. There's other strategies that will happen after I leave office around more development throughout the city. And we also have our inclusionary housing policy that we've just adopted, recognizing that whenever we have increased density, which means new development, that we also need to respectfully ensure that we're collecting enough fees to build our infrastructure. And so I fully support this. I don't have the agenda item in front of me right now, but I'd love to see what our impact fees are and what other cities are doing. Thank you for bringing this item. It's been talked about for a while, so appreciate it, Mr. Vice Mayor. Can I just jump in real quick on this one?
Speaker 0: Yes, go ahead.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to point out that all the back up materials for this item are actually on the agenda for tonight, including the presentation that was made. So this remote, if I just wanted to point out that staff did follow up on this particular item.
Speaker 0: Hey. Thank you. I'll consider something. I'll just speak from the side of. Thank you. I support the motion as articulated. Thank you very much. Craig, would you please call for the vote?

Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember Austin. I'm just going to I want to just add that this is a fantastic project. This Ali vacation will allow us to expand and support the incredible work of Lazar Fish, which is an early tech company within the city of Long Beach that took a chance on Long Beach. And I always want to recognize that they went in, took a chance. Now they are growing by hundreds and hundreds of jobs on their campus and creating a model facility in Bixby Knolls as a gateway. They're clearing oil fields are replacing fences, they're doing landscaping, they're fixing alleys. And they're the exact example of the type of corporate partner you would want in your community. And so I want to thank Mr. Wacker and his entire team. They're really doing a great job and thank the councilmember for his incredible support. And this project would not be where it's at if it wasn't for his support as well. And with that, there's in motion any second. So let me please ask you to cast their votes.

This project will provide significant cost savings to the city, improve local grid reliability and reduce carbon emissions, as we already heard tonight from me and others. Long Beach is has been and is a leader and innovator in more efficient use of its energy resources, promoting sustainability and reducing emissions.

Please come forward. Are you on the consent calendar.
Speaker 3: Please? Kitchen counter. My name is Victoria Marshall. I have a couple of comments to this. Say you guys.
Speaker 1: Are.
Speaker 3: Saying that you guys win. Which one was it? The legislation and the state issues. You guys want to turn around and, you know, destroy records from internal affairs or whatever, documentations or whatever. How does that help the community if I'm trying to, you know, file a complaint or issue with internal affairs about an incident and you guys are destroying records or any type of proof of the complaint that I'm trying to file or whatever. I don't really understand. How is that helping the community if there are problems, you know, are different things are coming up and these are the only records that I'm able to go by. If these, you know, items are being destroyed by the Internal Affairs Division, how would I go back and be able to, you know, target them or say that they're doing something wrong when the items would no longer be there? I requested a lot of of, you know, paperwork and documents from being harassed by, you know, police officers, different things of that nature, different organizations, paperwork that, you know, I'm filing, you know, with, regardless if it's the multipurpose center, Section eight, whatever housing paperwork that's supposed to be available to me every time we question is paperwork or whatever is either is not showing up in your eye systems or has no documentation of it. So I'm being erased. Every trail I go through, just be heard. The question is, find out why things are taking so long. All the documentation is constantly being erased and I don't know what to do, how to stop it, how to get the information before it is deleted. But it's like a cover up of anything and everything that a person is doing. They do not want to be acknowledged, are aware of, and I feel like I'm not being protected by you guys and I don't have money to go out and pay for a lawyer or, you know, someone that knows the trail to get to these documents before they're destroyed. And it doesn't say which departments are destroying them at what time or what dates or nothing else. So I don't know if evidence is going to be lost forever by me not coming here, because this is only the only trail that actually shows that I had been here going requested help. Don't ask what's going on and everything else. But when I go in I try to get documentation of this is like it doesn't exist. Thank you.

Speaker 0: Yes, again, this is a the same kind of this is another property also by Raintree. This one out 127 through 135 East Broadway. Again the during the Jones period. It was discovered that a major dedication would be required.
Speaker 4: A reduction in the price of a $1.3 million would be required. Again, this item has been available to cities, economists and yes, to the council members.
Speaker 0: Item notation a rain tree great porter in the city.
Speaker 4: Has actually been, you know, waiting patiently while we've been exploring the economic analysis of our third party consultant to make sure that the reduction in is was justified. They are ready to go and we will be breaking ground as soon as entitlements are received. So thank you very much to Raintree and their patients and looking forward to two great projects in the downtown and bring over 400 units to the downtown. So thank you very much.
Speaker 7: Thank you. Any further comment? So none Mr. Wood here.
Speaker 0: Forgive me, but that sounds, in other case, like flies on garbage. It reminds me of what we went through a few years ago when Don I the last Mr. Dean had a property and the city were saying, this is here to auction piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted. And of course, the dean bought it. And within before the ink was dry, before the ink was dry, made $1,000,000 in profit. And if that wasn't bad enough, if that wasn't bad enough, a few weeks later, somebody else said, Oh, that orphaned piece of property has a cousin. And another piece of property that nobody wanted, nobody wanted they sold. And don't quote the exact I think the price was somewhere between 9 to $0.11 an acre. That's almost as bad also as giving away the piece of property which the date is always memorialized in my room around the old hotel on a block from this convention center that nobody wanted and they gave it away for. I think it was a dollar. And that's easy to remember because that was the weekend of when Obama was in Cartagena and even the the ladies down there were holding out for their price. They didn't give up like this city council. One says.
Speaker 7: Sir, sir, you cannot sir, you cannot speak out during the council meeting I Well then you have to leave and go outside. It doesn't matter. You cannot sing or speak during the council meeting. Mr.. Good. To continue.
Speaker 8: To do.
Speaker 0: My apology. You know, it's not it's no wonder it's no wonder the that company came to Long Beach. And got the contract for, what is it, near $10 million to build a parking lot? If he knew right where the garbage was. Right where the garbage was, right here. And then what if we find they had an extensive record of fraud, embezzlement, crime? They felt a long basis for police to come so forth. Thank you.
Speaker 7: There's a motion in a second, Councilmember Pearce.
Speaker 3: Yes, I did want to just take a little the opportunity that I didn't take previously to say when I met with Raintree, I just really was excited about thinking outside of the box and going above and beyond what's required in a project like this. And so looking at the alleyways, talking about doing the mural, the walkability there, connecting the promenade to areas that we typically don't think to connect to, including the arts, and also thinking creatively about our parking challenges that we have. So I just wanted to publicly say I really appreciate the partnership that we've already started. So thank you.
Speaker 7: Thank you. Please cast your vote.
Speaker 6: Motion carries.
Speaker 7: Okay. Thank you. Thanks again. And we're going to go ahead, go back to the regular agenda item 29."
LongBeachCC_10172017_17-0944,"Speaker 1: Thank you. Can I just make one motion for all the rest? I'm joking. Item number 12, please.
Speaker 0: Report from police recommendation to.
Speaker 4: Execute an.
Speaker 0: Agreement with the Long Beach Community.
Speaker 4: College District to provide law enforcement security services and an estimated amount of $3,000,102. 526 districts. Five and six.
Speaker 1: Thank you. And this motion. District five and. Okay, fine. All right. It's been moved and seconded. Any public comment on this item? Larry. Good. You while I support this item. I think it's good to keep in mind. And it's a reminder, though, notwithstanding the good effort the police department have, the ranks, the numbers of the police are down at a all time low. And it's going to be, what, 3 to 4 years before we're back up there. And it what sharpens. This is what happened on the blue line two days ago. Which was I? One of probably the worst experiences I've seen when the train left. PCH for Willow took about six and a half minutes and there was a very violent in terms of conduct and language mail attacking verbally and walking back and forth and threatening or using language, in your words. That has never crossed my lips or anybody I know of. And that continued on. And it's a matter of record. I've called the MTA, wrote rid of written a letter. It call also the police. Right then there was no police on the station at PCH, none at Pacific Coast Highway, none in Willow. When the train pulled into Willow, I walked up to knocked. I left one part of the car, walked up to the front, took the bike, walked up, knock on the door. The driver asked him to call the police and his response was and he had heard that and he said, well, he hasn't hurt her yet has he . So forth. And I suggest I told him to call the police. He would not. And I told and this is going to be your last day of work. If that if he didn't do that, that underscores the need of addressing the situation and taking the police that we. Are assigned to the police to the through line, which we don't have. They weren't there. And more often than not, not not there. Over and above the fact that transit policing is a specialized detail. And this council needs to step up to that fact and realize it and take the necessary steps to return the policing of the transit system to the trained professionals under Sheriff McDonnell. And there's the the approach every major city in the world has, i.e., a specialized trained force. To ride the transportation, which very few of these council members ride. Thank you. Thank you. So that concludes public comment. Members, please cast your vote.
Speaker 0: Motion carries.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Before we proceed, I move that we reconsider item number 11. And unless someone is second second, the motion to reconsider.
Speaker 0: Is.
Speaker 1: Not yet. We have to vote on the reconsideration. Could somebody second reconsideration? What do you have to say? Vocally, I say okay. Reconsider is not debatable. Right? I'm sorry. The question I have to reconsider. There's a potential conflict of interest. We have to vote on the reconsideration before we take the item, correct? That's correct. Okay. So any discussion on the reconsideration saying nonmembers members raise your hand if you're okay with reconsideration of item number 11. Okay. Madam Clerk, it looks like that approved.

We have multiple businesses here. Him and his wife also on a very successful salon, but I'm not sure. My wife and I are on a speech pathology clinic up in Bixby because we have one in Garden Grove as well. I own a real estate investment holding company and we just love 100. So we spend all the time, all our money in Long Beach. We're just super grateful to have the opportunity to have this like wonderful places. But since early sixties, you know, just kind of continue. It wasn't the nicest place in the neighborhood for a long time. We busted our butts and got it really cleaned up and made it really nice. We actually went out and got some really nice chefs from Long Beach to kind of come in and do all of our consulting for our menu. And all of the neighbors are thrilled because they wouldn't go in there before it, and now they're in there maybe once or twice a week. So it's been really nice.

LongBeachCC_02142017_17-0099,"Speaker 1: Item 20 East Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson Council Membership in Councilwoman Mango and Council Memo Durango. Recommendation to request the City Manager to work with South Coast Air Quality Management District to report on the impacts of the City of Paramount air quality to Long Beach residents.
Speaker 4: Councilmember I'm sorry. Vice Mayor.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Here in Long Beach, we border a number of cities, and in the ninth district border, the cities of Paramount, Bellflower, Bellflower, Lakewood, Compton, and the community of Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated section of L.A. County. So issues commonly across across commonly cross city boundaries. What's important that we stay up to date on manner matters that can potentially impact our residents? Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods. In October 2016, the South Coast Air Quality Management District began investigating two metal processing facilities in the city of Paramount after detecting hexavalent chromium, a potentially cancer causing metal. And in the interests of transparency, we placed this motion on the agenda to request city staff to do our diligence and coordinate with HQ, M.D. and City Paramount to better understand any impacts that this incident has had on our Long Beach residents and their quality of life. So tonight we're beginning that conversation and that discussion and will ask city staff to come back to the City Council with their full findings after engaging HQ, M.D. So we'll start with a brief staff report in a few questions now.
Speaker 2: Diana Chang, our manager of Government Affairs. I can talk a little bit about this item.
Speaker 3: Vice Mayor, Council and mayor. We are aware that there are concerns that the City of Paramount and accused have around their metal.
Speaker 5: Facilities without.
Speaker 3: Getting into too much detail on on.
Speaker 5: The findings that a Camden Paramount have been.
Speaker 3: Discovering. We are willing and interested in working with the Air Quality Management District and our neighbors on figuring out any impacts to Northampton and the city of Long Beach.
Speaker 0: Okay. And I just have a few questions, Miss Mustang two, and I would hope that the responses could be included in whatever report comes back. I'd like to better understand what hexavalent hexavalent chromium is. I'd like to know the difference between a regular metal shop and the ones that have hexavalent chromium emissions. I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters. And so we want to understand the difference between those two and understand where they where they are that are in Long Beach and close to Long Beach. So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?
Speaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.
Speaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.
Speaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.
Speaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?
Speaker 3: Yes, that is correct.
Speaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?
Speaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.
Speaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?
Speaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.
Speaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much. And so that's my motion to come back in 45 days with a report.
Speaker 4: Any other accounts, comments, seen, any public accounts of your anger?
Speaker 2: I want to I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. I know how equality is important to his neighborhoods as it is in mine. So I'm glad that you're bringing this forward and I strongly support it.
Speaker 4: Katie, public comment CNN. Okay. We'll go ahead and do the this motion for this for this report. Then with consensus, no objection. Next item.
Speaker 6: To.
Speaker 1: Item 21 is a report from financial management recommendations received for the fiscal year 2016 year end budget performance report citywide."
LongBeachCC_10112016_16-0929,"Speaker 1: Motion carries.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Item number 13, please.
Speaker 1: Communication from City Attorney. Recommendation to adopt resolution expressing its intent to prioritize spending of marijuana business license tax revenue for specific purposes.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Price.
Speaker 5: Yes, I'd like any money that that is generated as a result of the tax to go to the items and areas specified by the city attorney in the resolution with a special focus on public health and safety. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Great. Thank you. And I'll just add my comments here. In August, we submitted this this resolution indicating our intent to use the business license, tax revenue for public safety, public health, homelessness, and general services for regulation and enforcement. And it's great to see that in the final resolution, all of these will be prioritized for spending if this tax passes. So I do want to thank city staff and the City Council for collaboration on this resolution to ensure that the revenue is spent in a way that fully benefits our city and our residents and recovers any costs associated with the regulation of the medical marijuana ordinance should it pass by the voters. So, Councilmember Pearce.
Speaker 4: Yes. I also want to thank staff for their report that they did previously and just want to reiterate that do want to see the funds go to cost recovery, prioritize that and then additionally making sure that we are addressing things like first responder times both with our police and our fire, that we are using these dollars to bring back our public safety. And then you know that. When we have that in the general fund, I would definitely support any additional funding after cost recovery and public safety. Again, going to issues of health equity and and areas like that that can be addressed through services. So thank you for your work on this.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Andrews.
Speaker 6: Thank you, Vice Mayor. You know, I'd like to thank Mr. Parkins for drafting this resolution. And I would hope that when we talk about public safety, we're not only talking about police and enforcement, but the critical fire service as well. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item?
Speaker 6: Mm hmm.
Speaker 1: Good evening, my Mayor Richardson and honorable city council members. My name is Margaret Dudley and I live in the ninth District. And I would just like to speak on the. The priority for the. The measure a spending funding. I believe you're going to need that for first responders. Police first. Hospitals, mental health care. Also paramedics. You're going to need it also for attorney lawyers because it's going to be a lot of lawsuits. So you need to prioritize that money that you're going to get from Missouri for that. Thank you very much.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Margaret. Next.
Speaker 7: Night seven works in Soho district is for two resident. Speaking on this agenda item for two different reasons. One, as I stated before, the current tax rates that are being considered under measure M-A are cost prohibitive for a business that is that is currently built for businesses that are going to be taxed under federal schedule to 80 , an effective rate of anywhere between 50 and 80%. So for the purpose of controlling the black market, the best way to meet and to ensure that that will happen is to give support to the businesses that are putting putting themselves in front of the breach and accepting the registration and working within written to the the created regulatory scheme. As such, it would be, you know, even a business like a business tax that anywhere from 8 to 12% is really cost prohibitive for, especially in the retail sector. Secondly, in the interest of protecting measure, it may and the ability in the city's ability to tax at this particular at at these levels, it's I think the city's being too cute by half by engaging in what is by all means a special tax. Any proposition to analysis that goes into the legislative intent of this measure, especially the ones that are being expressed at this turning time, especially for specific allocations towards public towards public safety and cost allocation, as we're talking about, really indicates something that is a special tax and that's fantastic. If the city wants to raise money for first responders, mental health, public health, I'll go along with them. But you also are going to be subject to it to the to it towards passing that particular measure at a two thirds rate, not a 50% plus one. Simple as that. Thank you. And have a good day.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Take it back behind the rail. Let's go ahead. And members, please cast your vote.
Speaker 1: Motion carries.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Let's have item number 14."
LongBeachCC_02092016_16-0125,"Speaker 0: Communication from Council member Richardson, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilman Price and Councilman Austin recommendation to request a resolution in support of National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month in February.
Speaker 1: Councilman Richardson.
Speaker 10: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. National Teen Dating, Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month is an effort to raise awareness about abuse in teen relationships and promote programs that prevent it during the month of February. Unfortunately, dating violence among teens is more common than most people know, according to a recent all national recent national survey. One in ten teens reported being hit or physically hurt, hurt by purpose or hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend once in the last 12 months. In addition, one in four teenagers have been in a relationship where a partner is verbally abusive. By supporting the National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, that's that's a mouthful. We as a city can bring awareness to the issue on a local level and demonstrate our commitment to fostering and supporting a healthier community for all. And we're going to hear during public comment from Candi Lewis, executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. Ms.. Lewis will share with us what her organization is doing to help address teen teen dating violence and how we can support their efforts. And with that, I'll move to move the item.
Speaker 1: It's a motion in a second, Councilwoman Gonzalez.
Speaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think it's really important we make sure that we're talking about teen dating violence, both traditional and also via social media and other formats. It's really important. Our teens are certainly the future, and we want to make sure that, you know, that this council is very supportive of of what you're doing. And hopefully, if you are going through anything, you can seek support. But I look forward to hearing from the public and hearing a little bit more about about this issue. But let's stay on this. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Any public comment on the item? Seeing nonmembers, please cast your votes. I didn't see over there.
Speaker 9: I.
Speaker 1: Let's let's let that lady make a few comments.
Speaker 4: Thank you, Mayor Garcia, Councilmember Richardson and the esteemed council members. My name is Candy Lewis, and I am the executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. We are a nonprofit, and our mission is to address teen dating violence and sexual assault in youth and communities of color. Teen dating violence is an epidemic. And the numbers that you've heard are just reported. The reported numbers are dismal, but the actual numbers are even worse right now. 90 every 90 seconds, a girl in the United States is assaulted. But that's only reported. That's a girl this over 12 years old. And so we're not really showing those correct numbers, according to our surveys that we have personally done in the last five years. We've had over 2200 people that we've surveyed. 37% were African-American. 43% were Latino, Latina, 9% white, 5% Asian, 33%. Pacific Islander, two Middle Eastern, 2%. Middle Eastern. 48% of youth and young adults have experienced sexual assault, dating and domestic violence by the sixth grade. 60.3% of youth and young adults report being hit, slapped, grabbed, pinch, spit, act, and over 60% didn't realize that they could be in a dating and domestic violence relationship. Teen dating violence looks like physical assault, verbal abuse, emotional mental, physical stalking and of course, cyber. And we thank you very much for bringing this to your to the city's attention. It is a national resolution. And because of your support, we'll be able to bring local work, a local commitment here into the city of Long Beach. There's a lot of work that's already being done, but it's not nearly enough because all of our children are impacted. Violence and abuse actually starts in the womb, and if we do not address it, we are going to have a worse problem. Right now, the numbers are 36% of every pregnant woman is physically assaulted. 36%. If we were to turn around and look at the audience and ask them, how many of you have experienced teen dating violence , domestic violence or sexual assault? I'm sure almost everyone would be because every one of us is impacted by it. If it's not in our family, it is in our neighbors, it's in our children. And so I thank you very much for bringing this to light. We do have additional information that we will be happy to share with you. I also have something for you all. I brought our brochure that talks about the work that we do. We not only address teen dating violence and sexual assault, but we also address bullying healthy relationships. Because if we do not talk about healthy relationships, we won't be talking about any relationships as well. And our organization has been partner with all state foundation to eliminate teen dating violence and sexual assault. And so I have a little something for everyone.
Speaker 1: Thank you, ma'am. Time to time is up. If you can just leave the stuff for for the clerk. That's for you. Thank you very.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Rasmussen.
Speaker 3: Yes. This is and I'm sorry.
Speaker 0: This is a routine amendment where we set the date for a public hearing, and this will be a public hearing on the Danny substation site at Pontius and Denny. And thank you. That is what we'll do.
Speaker 2: Do we have a date set?
Speaker 0: It is in the resolution itself. If you have a copy of that. Well, maybe somebody could. We will find a solution.
Speaker 4: Up in the restaurant. You didn't exactly seem prepared on this since.
Speaker 3: I was.
Speaker 0: Getting prepared for the next meeting. Does somebody have it up on their screen?
Speaker 3: July 30th.
Speaker 1: I had my.
Speaker 3: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Councilmember. It's July 30. All right. So we're setting a date for a public hearing. That's all we're doing. And that public hearing will be held here in chambers on July 30. And we know the time. It would be at 936.
Speaker 3: At the Belltown Community Center. Oh.
Speaker 0: So it's July 30 at 930 in the morning at the Belltown Community Center.
Speaker 3: Five 3530.
Speaker 0: In the.
Speaker 3: Morning. Sometimes it takes teamwork to do these things.
Speaker 0: Teamwork. All right. We'll say that one more time. It's July 30th, 530 in the evening. Belltown Community Center. Okay, great. Thank you. Are there any other questions or comments? Yes, Councilmember.
Speaker 1: So on. I'm glad we have the day because that was my whole comment is about why we should let people know when the hearing is. They just want to say that usually allegations are non-controversial issues. But I just wanted to draw a little attention to this one. As chair of the Energy Committee, this litigation is for the construction of the Denny substation, which is a very large Seattle City Light project in the middle of the Cascade neighborhood, the residential neighborhood and several low income housing buildings are immediately adjacent to the construction site, and substations usually don't go in such dense, densely populated areas. But this one is an exception. I do know that City Light has done a lot of outreach so far to the community and has found ways in which to mitigate the potential impact of the construction of this project on the neighbors. And I support moving forward to the public hearing. Just wanted to highlight the hearing just in case somebody is listening and wants an opportunity to comment. So thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. So to repeat again, the hearing is July 35, 30 PM at the Bell Town Community Center. Any other questions or comments? All in favor of adopting Resolution 31594 setting the public hearing vote. I oppose vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted. Is there any other business? Councilmember Gardner, the Central Waterfront Committee will meet next. And beginning at what time?
Speaker 2: May I suggest that because of the very large number of citizens here in support of the resolution on the Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom flag, please can we plan 15 minutes between full council and the waterfront committee so that council members may briefly join the community in the birthday Atlantis room if they wish. However, since we do expect an audience at the Waterfront Committee and we will not be able to start the committee until there are at least five council members. So let's be back promptly at 330.
Speaker 3: All right.
Speaker 0: Thank you. So we'll reconvene at 330 as the Select Committee on the Central Waterfront. The city council is now adjourned."
SeattleCityCouncil_09122016_Res 31702,"Speaker 10: Agenda item three Resolution 31702 Supporting Washington Initiative Measure 1491 and urging Seattle voters to vote yes on Initiative 1481 on the November 8th, 2016 general election ballot.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much. So this resolution supports the initiative. 1491. I'm sorry. Here. I have a lot of paperwork in front of me. And as you well know, 1491 is an initiative to the people of our state relative to, I say, urging voters to vote yes relative to a law that would suspend a person's access to firearms if there's documented evidence that an individual is threatening harm to themselves or others because of dangerous mental illness or a high risk of violent behavior. And if you look at the substance of the resolution itself, and I'm not at this point in the proceeding, I'm just describing the context. This is not my pro or con statement. I'm just describing the context of the resolution. And then I will ask for comments, either pro or con, but the University of California in 2014 I'm sorry, there are several incidents that have saddened our country that are described in the legislation itself, such as the incident in 2014, the University of California in Santa Barbara here in 2013 and Cafe Racer 2006. Jewish Federation of Seattle, the Seattle shooting. We can list the types of egregious behavior we've seen in this initiative. 1491 is modeled on the successful laws around the country and is based on a well-established Washington state system protection orders to fill the gaps in the system that allow people experiencing crisis or demonstrating violent behavior to possess and purchase firearms. So as described in the resolution, the contents are for the public safety of all people, including those who harm themselves. And at this point, I will move to pass Council Bill three. I will move to adopt Resolution 31701 and then I'll ask for comments after has been moved to adopt as their second. Okay. I'm sorry. 702i move to adopt resolution 31731702. Is there a second? Okay. Now, at this point, are there any comments regarding this resolution? So hearing then from my colleagues again, I'll just say it. Councilman Burgess, did you want to say a few words? Please do.
Speaker 7: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Council members, before you begin, I just want to make it clear as the rules that aren't known by many that the inclusion of our comments, we will hear comments from members of the public who wish to speak in opposition, and we will allow the same amount of time for those people as well as the rules require. Councilman Burgess.
Speaker 7: Thank you very much. This measure 1491, which we all get to vote on here in a few weeks at the November election, is another common sense measure around gun safety. The vast majority of gun violence incidents in the state of Washington and frankly, across the United States, almost three quarters of those cases involve suicide or unintentional shootings , what some people refer to as accidental shootings. And in many of those cases, members of families or close personal friends are often aware of the looming crisis that is being presented to a family. And so with the passage of this initiative in November, family members will be able to go before a court and petition for a protection order, which may include the seizure of firearms in the possession of someone who is at great risk. And I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting this measure, supporting initiative 1491, and that the people of Washington state will likewise support that initiative.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Burgess. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? I do have at least one person who may want to speak in opposition to this particular item. And Mr.. Mr.. Locke, did you wish to speak on this item, sir, at all dealing with the Firearm Initiative Measure 1491. Did you wish to speak to that? You had signed up on several lists? No. Well, let me call for any public comment. Are there any members of the public comment that would like to speak in opposition to this particular resolution or to initiative measure 1491? He? We do. Please come forward, ma'am. And, Amelia, can you make sure this is safe?
Speaker 4: I didn't think I was going to be talking on this issue today. But I am Cynthia Lynette, the author, the artist who has produced a body of work called The Gun Show. It will be passed around. I'm very concerned about this resolution that anybody, a family member can take somebody to court. And I don't care about taking away their guns, but then they're going to be required to go through some kind of psychiatric help. And you know what that means?
Speaker 5: That means psychotropic drugs. And we do not want them anymore.
Speaker 4: So if you could put something in here that says we are not going to give these people psychotropic drugs or require them to take it, then I might consider this. Otherwise, it is not good.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your words. Do any of my colleagues wish to provide any further comments on this resolution? Okay. Hearing then those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i. I. Those opposed vote no. The motion carries. The resolution stopped and chair will sign it. Please read the next agenda item.
Speaker 10: Agenda item four Resolution 31703 Supporting Washington Initiative Measure 1433 and urging Seattle voters to vote yes on Initiative 1433 on the November eight, 2016 general election ballot."
SeattleCityCouncil_08082016_Res 31690,"Speaker 0: Thank you. The bill passes the material signage report of the full council. Please read the report.
Speaker 1: Because the report, the full council agenda item one, resolution 316 19, providing an honorary designation of South Jackson Street from 27 south to 23rd Avenue South. S Ernestine Anderson Way.
Speaker 0: The council member o'brien.
Speaker 2: Thank you. So this is coming directly to full council. This ordinance would direct to the Seattle Department of Transportation to manufacture, install and maintain honourary signs at the intersections of South Jackson Street and 20th Avenue, South South Jackson Street and 20th Place, south South Jackson Street and 22nd Avenue, South and South Jackson Street and 23rd Avenue South . Each will reflect the Ernestine Anderson Way honorary designation. Racine Anderson was a legendary American jazz and blues singer from Seattle Center Area and graduate of Garfield High School and Ernestine Anderson Place, a senior affordable housing complex, was constructed in 2012 on South Jackson Street between 20th Avenue South and 20th place south. So this designation will occur adjacent to that housing complex. I did not have an honor to hear Ernestine Anderson perform. She passed away at the age of 87 earlier this year. But her legacy certainly is impressive. One anecdote I read in her obituary talked about how she was born in Houston and moved to Seattle in high school , and her father came to Seattle looking for work, but also because he wanted to be on the West Coast. And Seattle is like a sleepy town where he could get his daughter away from the music scene. Little did he know that Garfield in the Central District at that time was just emerging, and she played a significant role in that. And her overlap with Quincy Jones and Ray Charles and other folks who were in the music scene in Seattle at that time were impressive. This is a great a great chance to honor one of the leaders in our community for so long and look forward to voting yes on this bill.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rodney, for the comments. Alex, say a few words. No one else would. Casper and Brian, thank you for describing Ms.. Anderson's background. And many people have been around Seattle for decades and many are recent arrivals. And I just think it's critically important when we celebrate this kind of history is, as you described, she recorded over 37 albums in her lifetime and she was really celebrated as a jazz artists throughout the world when she attended Garfield High School. That's where she met Quincy Jones. And you have to talk publicly about Quincy was a classmate of my mother and father's at Garfield. High school. And so I've had the opportunity to sort of over the years, interface with Miss Anderson's family. And her daughter Yvonne was attending school with myself. She's part of some great history in Seattle with groups such as Bumps Blackwell and Buddy Catlett and, of course, Quincy Jones. And those folks, if you go to the Safeway on 23rd and in Madison, you'll see a picture of a group called Bumps Blackwell. That many folks. It was just one of the best jazz groups around. And Quincy Jones is in that picture. And my father is a saxophone player sitting right next to Quincy Jones. So it's quite extraordinary what talent has come out of this city. Quincy Jones described Ernestine his voice as, quote, honey at dusk, and he said that the world got a taste of her honey. And she performed in the Monterey Jazz Festivals at Carnegie Hall in the White House during the first inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower at the Kennedy Center. She toured Europe and had many concerts in London and New York. So again, quite a local treasure. In 1999, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer, Brian Lenker published a book I think many of you have heard of. It's called I Dream a World. And in that book, she he describes 75 women, African-American women who really changed America, Coretta Scott King, Sarah Vaughan, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks and our own Ernestine Anderson is in that book. So, so again, she's quite a legend. And I think as we preserved what's great in this city, I think part of that is actually preserving names like Reverend McKinney and Ernestine Anderson and others. So I'm very happy to support this resolution. You know the comments. Okay. So those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i, i, those opposed vote no. The ayes have it. The motion carries and resolutions adopted and chair Cheryl, sign it. Next agenda item, please."

Speaker 2: Councilmember Juarez I believe Councilmember Herbold has a substitute motion to make.
Speaker 5: I move to amend Resolution 31765 by substituting version two for version one B.
Speaker 1: Second.
Speaker 0: And moved in second to make a substitution and customer service. Do you want to explain what we're doing here, please?
Speaker 5: Yes, absolutely. So the substitute adds three new sets of language. The first is to add a recital to recognize the council's letter of June 26 and adds it as an attachment. Also, together with that, central staff included recommending a recital that actually refers to the letter. The second set of amendments actually incorporates two edits to memorialize and recognize in two separate places the work that Councilmember Suarez has spearheaded for an independent council consultant for Financial Review. The first edit adds a recital with language from the consultant funding request and the second notes Council's intent to review that council consultant work in Section two . And then the third amended language is to Section one. And it says specifically, in order for the council to potentially carry out review by the end of the year. The intent is to add context to this section regarding what the Council needs in order to have a chance to fulfill the goal of taking final action by the end of the year, as referenced in Section four.
Speaker 0: Very good, Councilmember. Whereas we know this is a friendly manner and amendment, I take it. Would you like to say any more just about the amendment?
Speaker 2: I have no comment to the amendment, but I certainly can speak to the resolution.
Speaker 0: Okay. And just to sort of clarify the record, this is resolution 31764. I don't know if it's read correctly.
Speaker 5: I'm sorry, six five. My bad. Okay.
Speaker 0: So we're six four. So any questions? Just on the amendment piece. Okay. All those in favor of substituting version two for version one B, say I. I opposed the ayes have it. So now we have a new version in Council member. Whereas would you like to speak to that?
Speaker 2: Thank you. In regards to resolution 316 for this resolution, as we discussed this morning, is to memorialize the agreements and benchmarks we've already laid out in the last four meetings of this year. I want to thank Councilmember Bagshaw and Councilmember Harrell for co-sponsoring this resolution with me. This resolution expresses our commitment to review the MCU that is sent to us in any other documents or legal issues that would be would remain in the purview of the legislative branch. It would maintain authority to prove all subsequent agreements, and we will be ensuring the motion meets our expectations, especially those as laid out in the RFP . I want to thank Councilmember Herbold, Gonzales and Johnson for raising many important and substantive questions and issues. And I also want to thank Councilmember Burgess for his words regarding our duty, our fiduciary duty, and our due diligence in any documents that come from the executive regarding these type of agreements. Always want to end is that more input is always better and I remain committed to this process and working with my colleagues. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilman warns any further comments on the amended resolution from any of my colleagues? Okay. I think we'll be ready to vote. So I move to adopt resolution 31764, second and second. Those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended. Vote i, i. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries resin. Solution is adopted as amended and the chair will sign it.

SeattleCityCouncil_02212017_CB 118912,"Speaker 5: The report of the Energy Environment Committee and item ten Constable 1189 12 relating to the satellite department and the Department of Parks Recreation superseding Section seven of Ordinance 124 917 and transferring jurisdiction of the former Dulwich substation from the City Light Department to the Department of Parks and Recreation for Open Space Park Immigration Purposes Committee recommends the bill pass.
Speaker 3: Thank you. Council members. So on.
Speaker 4: Thank you, Britain Brian. This council constable transfers of former substation property in the deluge neighborhood of Seattle from City Light to the Parks Department. Under state law, public utilities are financially distinct from the city, and so the property had to be sold at fair market value. In this case, the property was not part of Park's strategic plan, but the community wanted to maintain it as a greenspace. So the Delbridge Neighborhoods Development Association raised the money by winning grants to pay for it, and that menu is attached to the Council bill. I want to thank Dale Rich Neighborhoods Development Association for their work on behalf of their community and also thanks to City Light staff who as usual, have made sure to give the community the time they need to make the whole thing work. They went through a transparent process. My office also visited the property with the community members back in 2014, which is also a reflection of the careful way that City Light staff approached the disposition of property of this kind. And the committee recommends for council pass the bill.
Speaker 3: Thank you. Council members want any further comments? Councilmember Herbold.
Speaker 6: Thank you. I just want to say a few words. This project is in my district, District one. No, this is a project that our committee members have been working on for quite some time. I actually was on a community tour last week when this was being heard in committee. I want to thank the Parks Department for their funding contribution as well as King County for for theirs as well. The work that community members and our neighborhood district associations specifically I want to call out Willie Brown is fantastic in the vision for this property is really exciting as well. Not only will they be using the space for a natural wetland which will detail storm water runoff, alleviating flooding of neighborhood yards and driveways, but it will also provide a bio filtration of stormwater runoff before it enters Longfellow Creek. And then DDA will partner with Seattle Tilth and Nature Consortium and staff and students from Louisa Boren stem k through eight school to develop and manage the remaining part of the property as a permanent culture food forest. And this is really important for this community because Delbridge is a food desert. The land management system contains aspects of the native habitat with edible forest gardening and a children's garden will link classroom and field experience to educate local youth in environmental science and stewardship and atmosphere. So this is just a fantastic project. It's been a long time coming and thanks to Councilmember Swann as well for shepherding this legislation through her committee.
Speaker 3: Thank you for those comments. Councilmember Horrible. Any further comments? Please call the role on the passage of the bill.

Speaker 2: 9.0 95 to the ceremony. Speaker Committee recommends the bill pass.
Speaker 1: Casper. Mesquita.
Speaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I want to say thank you to our friends at the ACLU. The folks at ACLU, specifically Shanker and Orion, has been working to make sure that we put into place advanced meter infrastructure technology that protects the data of all consumers. Councilmember O'Brien has been working on this for a while, and I want to thank the folks at Seattle City Light and the Office of the Attorneys, the city attorneys as well. We have been able to craft legislation that I think accomplishes the following. We want to make sure that an AI led technology is implemented in a way to make sure that we can monitor energy efficiency and improve the collection of actual data so that our bills reflect the actual usage and that we can identify ways to improve energy efficiency over the long haul. What we know is that because of Councilmember Brian and the previous council here, there has been policies put into place in rules that do protect consumer data. What this legislation does is it codifies our commitment to making sure that all data is truly protected, that we as a city and our subcontractors don't share, disclose or make available consumer data in a way that would be inappropriate. We want to make sure that every customer, every resident in Seattle feels comfortable using the AMI technology and for those who don't. This legislation also sets limits on the fees associated with opting out, making it clear that they can be no more than the cost of actually reading the alternative meter. So that I think that we create a little bit more parity here. Again, I think that this is important for us as we get into new areas where we're using technology in different ways, where we're collecting data that we haven't collected in the past. We need to step up and make sure that our contracts and our commitment to protect data reflect each other. So I'm really excited about the type of commitments this will put in place for contracts in the future. We also want to make sure that the customers feel that we have responded to their concerns with urgency, and I think that this legislation does that. So I appreciate the past steps that Seattle City has made, and I really hope that the Council will adopt this resolution or sorry, adopt this ordinance today to codify these rules into statute. Again, I want to thank Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you to your staff, especially Lakeisha Farmer, who's been working with us on this. And I look forward to working with you all to make sure that we implement these councilmember action. Councilmembers have been very helpful as well in our committee as we talked about this issue multiple times over the last few months. So thank you to all of you for your collaboration and for helping us to find the right path forward on AMI protections.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Customers get any comments?
Speaker 4: Councilmember Yeah. Thank you. I want to go right back at Councilmember Mosquito. I really appreciated the time you've spent on this and bringing Seattle City Light to the table. But also, I think importantly, a number of our I would consider them to be some of the loyal opposition around privacy that they wanted to make sure that we were not going in and getting data from people's homes and businesses that they felt was personal. And the fact that we had ACLU involved in the conversations and that at our last meeting, I asked one of the speakers directly. Are you supporting this legislation as is? And the answer was yes. So thank you so much for the work that you've done in pulling this together. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Q Councilmember O'Brien.
Speaker 8: Thank you for your comments, Councilman Muscat. I appreciate the recognition, but I want to say that to get it to this point required a lot of work, and it was just a lot of back and forth on nuances of working with attorneys in the department. And I want to give credit to the city attorney's office and Seattle, see the light for them showing up for those conversations. But I know you and your team put a lot of time into getting it here, and I'm grateful to get the chance to work with you on this. I'm really proud of this legislation and thank you for doing that.

But appreciate that the council rules were amended in December 2017 so that the assumption would be made that if anybody wanted to use the call in option during any family leave, they had the ability to do so. So we'll let you know as soon as possible. And otherwise, I look forward to seeing you soon.

Item number four on today's agenda. We talked about quite a bit this morning. This is related to the federal grants that we are accepting. There's a number of important federal grants that are accepted at the end of the year each year. There has been a document that was circulated this weekend by Greg Doss from central staff. And we appreciate all of the work that they did over the weekend to help answer questions that stemmed from the robust discussion in our committee meeting on Wednesday. One of the things that you should also note, in addition to the questions that we have submitted that resulted in 11 page response document, is that Director Noble has sent a letter today to make sure that if there are any additional questions that those get answered before those 2021 allocations are spent. And that's an important commitment from the CBO office, from Director Noble, that he has sent this letter to us, which you all should have received just around 2 p.m. today, to make sure that any additional questions specifically as well related to Homeland Security grants do get answered. As the council member, Strauss discussed this morning. There was a long conversation in Wednesday on Wednesday's meeting, and I do have additional concerns and questions that I will be submitting. Folks are asked by Alex Nucci and Greg Doss that if you do have additional questions that are not yet answered in that 11 page document, please make sure that you send your questions by Wednesday at noon so that central staff can coordinate with the office to answer any additional questions. I want to make sure, though, as Vice-Chair Herbal did during our committee last year, that folks know that there's a number of really important grants that are included in the overall bill as well, and we want to make sure to move this forward to accept those grants. With that, I will be voting yes and the committee voted 5 to 0, recommending passage during full council today. Thank you very much, Madam President. And you consider our musketeer for that excellent report while multitasking. Well done. Are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Strauss and then Councilor, you want to go to Councilmember first? Okay. Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Strauss.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I also want to make note of Budget Director Ben Noble's commitment in the Budget Committee meeting to do more work with the Council prior to the the development and submittal of grants that may be of concern to the Council. An example of the work that this Council has done around funding sources that are of concern relates specifically to legislation in 2017 that the Council adopted. You might remember that that year I proposed to create a new section of the municipal code prohibiting Seattle Police Department participation in the U.S. Department of Defense 1033 program that allows cities to transfer excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies at no cost. This was a particular program that we had received concerns about, and in response, we, the chief, had had decided to no longer participate in that program. And then we sort of solidified that policy decision of of of chief best with this with this particular ordinance, I would suggest that our ongoing efforts to take a look at some of these grant sources might result in a request from the council to the department to no longer participate in in some of these grant sources. But I think that is really important work, and I appreciate that that we need to do moving forward. And I appreciate that we have a commitment from the Budget Director that we can take a deeper dove in the future before these grants are sought. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Oh, excellent. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Strauss.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Chairman Skater. And thank you. Also Chair Herbold. Also want to thank Director Noble for your letter. Your letter, as well as the conversation that I had with Greg Doss and Alex Nucci, have resolved the concerns that I have for today. And I will be following up with additional questions as per your letter has requested. I really just want to thank you, Director Noble, for sending that along and working with us in an expedient fashion as well. Again, a thank you to Dr. Fisher and Angela Sochi and Greg, for all of your work answering the 11 pages of questions over the weekend. Thank you, council president. I will be voting yes. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Now way to bury the lead counselor with Strauss. Thank you so much. Colleagues, are there any additional comments on the bill? Right. Hearing non-whites want to thank the chair and member Strauss and conservatives for their good work on getting as much information about this as we can. Lots more to always, particularly as it relates to oversight issues. So really look forward to the opportunity to continue to engage in that work. That being said, will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the.

Amending Section 4.04.250 and 4.08.040 of the standards for code and ratifying and confirming search and prior acts. Thank you, Madam Chair. I moved to pass Council Bill 119945. Is there a second? Second? Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Herbold, you are the prime sponsor of the bill and are recognized in order to address this item. Thank you so much. As discussed earlier this morning in council briefings, this bill relates to both the Civil Service Commission and the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. Both entities have three members, one that's appointed by the mayor, one that's appointed by the council, and one that's elected by the relevant city employees for the Public Safety Civil Service Commission. That is police and fire employees for the Civil Service Commission. It is nonexempt employees who do not work for the mayor or council or civil service commission staff. Both entities are having elections this year and things are slightly delayed.
Speaker 2: By.
Speaker 0: COVID 19. So this legislation allows the city clerk to hold the elections in December rather than November. It allows for electronic ballots rather than only physical ballots, though the option of paper ballots will still remain, and the schedule changes only for 2020. And these elements are only included in the ordinance, not the Seattle Municipal Code. There are some municipal code changes and that is only related to eliminating out dated language in the municipal code related to the election process. And it allows the city clerk to modernize the election election process by rule in the future.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbals, are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Peterson, please.
Speaker 1: Thank you, council president and thank you. Councilmember Herbold, a viewing public mind. I know, but during council briefing this morning, we talked a little bit about this particular council bill. And I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for clarifying and just want to point out to the public, the fiscal note does say that this legislation has contingent language to cover that. The Public Safety Civil Service Commission is because of the accountability ordinance from 2017, intended not to have any elected members in the future, so that this leaves open the possibility to implement that provision of the 2017 Accountability Police Accountability Ordinance, which I know several members on this Council were champions of that and authors of that. And so we, by passing this ordinance, are in no way signaling any sort of deviation from our commitment to implement the rest of that accountability ordinance, which which actually excluded employees from this commission. So thank you for clarifying that this morning.
Speaker 0: Great. Thank. Thanks so much, Casimir Peterson. Any other comments on the bill? Okay. Hearing. I appreciate the ongoing conversation here. I'm going to go ahead and ask the clerk to call the roll on the passage of the bill.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Council President. This legislation adopts amendments to the 2019 Annual Action Plan to detail how the city will spend approximately 8.9 million of dollars in federal funds allocated to the city through Housing and Urban Development for COVID response, including CBD funds, ESG and housing opportunities for people with AIDS or the Heart grant. These funds were appropriated by the Council through Ordinance of 126074 and 126084 passed in May. Funds have been allocated to the Human Services Department, Office of Housing and the Office of Economic Development to prevent, prepare and respond to the coronavirus. These funds will support emergency rental assistance, grant payments to small businesses and meal programs for people experiencing homelessness. In order to enter into grant agreements with HUD and to receive the funds, we have been directed to amend our most current annual action plans for these appropriations. You will note that we approved the 2020 Annual Action Plan in May. However, since the grant agreements for the 2020 Annual Action Plan have not yet been executed by Housing and Urban Development. The 2019 Annual Action Plan is still our current plan, and therefore we must send in that plan to receive these paired COVID emergency funds. Last week we held a public hearing on the legislation on Monday. Thank you to the public because the vote on that, this legislation is considered part of the budget rebalancing package. However, it is scheduled for a vote today because adoption of amendments to the annual action plans are required before these funds can be distributed. Thank you, Madam President.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda. Are there any additional comments or questions on the bill? Councilmember Herbold, please.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I just want to highlight for folks, both in our renter communities as well as to the folks who are providing rental housing to to renters, that this amended plan clearly states that the 1.4 million that the council previously moved away from rental assistance towards shelter will be spent on rental assistance. This plan will help ensure that desperately needed resources for homelessness, prevention and rental assistance are restored. I think as we originally intended a couple weeks ago now. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold. Any other questions or comments on the bill? Okay. Hearing it? None. I would ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.

Speaker 1: Second.
Speaker 0: It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill as sponsor of the bill. I will address that first and then see if any of you colleagues have comments to add. Council Bill 119794. As I discussed in this morning's council briefing is related to the Seattle Parking Enforcement Officers Guild's Collective Bargaining Agreement. This council bill would authorize the execution of a negotiated union contract between the city of Seattle and that bargaining unit. This is a three year contract from January 1st, 2019 through December 31st, 2021, and includes approximately 105 regularly appointed city employees in the Seattle Police Department. The financial terms of this union contract are similar to those of the State Coalition's union contracts and include a retroactive 4% annual wage increase for 2019 and a 3.6% annual wage increase for 2020. The financial and non-financial terms in this collective bargaining agreement were considered and approved by the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee and are within those previously approved parameters. I'm happy to entertain any questions or hear any comments from any of my colleagues. Councilmember Peterson.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Council President Gonzalez, I appreciate.
Speaker 3: The hard work of our Labor Relations Policy Committee and the difficult decisions that you have to make.
Speaker 2: I do not serve on that particular committee of legislative and executive leaders who represent management and who negotiate the multitude of employment contracts.

Speaker 2: I carefully consider each contract on its own terms, and.
Speaker 3: At this moment in time, with the grim.
Speaker 2: Fiscal challenges our city.
Speaker 3: Government faces today, I'll be voting no on this particular contract for parking enforcement officers. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, for those remarks. Just really quickly, I want to be just responsive to the extent that I can. We don't need to belabor the point, but this this particular contract, and based on the evaluation given to us by the city Budget Office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle. I think that I and the members of the Labor Relations Policy Committee, which include four other Council members and members of the executive team, carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure that this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible and within our existing means as a city and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance and that in approving this contract, we will not be subjecting the city budget to to further pressure or crisis as a result of the the the contract. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract. Any other questions or comments, colleagues? Because remember Lewis.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, Madam President. I do just want to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today. I think it's critical that as we go into what is going to be a very difficult a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer, in this fall, can we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly the employees that are included under this contract that provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together . This these are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure that we are maintaining adequately and that these are workers, that we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce. There's never been a more appropriate time, I think, to ratify a contract like this for this group of workers. I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure that we set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city. And I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there. That hasn't abated during this crisis. So I will be voting in favor of this.

Speaker 0: And adding and amending Section.
Speaker 2: 7.24 point 0/20.
Speaker 0: Columns. The Code Committee recommends the bill pass.
Speaker 2: Excellent counsel, colleagues. This is a bill that we introduced from my Office of Councilmember Mosquito about two years ago. We had an initial ordinance that asked for the Office of Housing to do an evaluation of the rent bidding platforms, and it also included a one year prohibition on the use of these platforms. The the prohibition was to provide our office with an an understanding of whether or not these platforms were in violation of our fair housing laws or to analyze how they may impact housing costs or inequities in our area. The Office of Housing needed additional time to complete the study, so we extended the prohibition for another year. In 2019, the Office of Housing has completed its report. It was sent to council last midyear last year and it found that it found that the city needed additional data to determine whether or not there was any impacts from rent bidding platforms on our Seattle Fair Housing Ordinance. And it recommended for specific actions. The piece of legislation in front of you updates our statute to make sure that we're repealing the prohibition and also includes provisions responsive to the Office of Housing Report. This includes a request that Office of Housing collect data to track whether or not meeting platforms are functioning for bidding purposes or other non bidding functions. And. And to determine whether or not the platforms are having an impact on equitable access to housing, it requests that the Office of Civil Rights conduct testing to determine if remedying platforms are in compliance with fair housing laws. It requests that if data shows that bidding platforms are having an impact on equitable access to housing, that the OCR and Office of Housing will provide recommendations on possible regulations to mitigate unintended consequences. And it encourages rent bidding platforms to post the Seattle Open Housing poster on their website. Colleagues, I would love to have your support on this. It came out of our Finance and Housing Committee with a unanimous vote and appreciate office of how things work to provide these recommendations to us. Are there any other comments? He's hearing none. Well, the point where the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.

The committee recommends the bill pass.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Lewis, it's all you.
Speaker 5: Thank you so much, Madam President. Hopefully, this can be a comparatively brief agenda item. Council Bill 120264 is aptly described by the title of the legislation. We heard a great presentation in committee last week from the Parks Department on the need to have a clearer regime to define what commercial activity might be in a park, and to have some kind of system to regulate the extent to which there can be allowed commercial activity, both in terms of the time and the space that that takes up in a public park going forward. So for the first time, this legislation creates a definition of what is considered commercial activity. To give a couple of examples of the kinds of activity parks has in mind that they would like to be able to facilitate with some level of consideration. And to do only permit would be something like an exercise class or a yoga class or some kind of mild food concession that might be seasonal. So some examples that were given were the food truck pilot for permitting in Westlake Park, which has been a fairly common occurrence over the last couple of years in the downtown core and potentially having services similar to that on a seasonal basis and some other parks around the city. This legislation was passed unanimously out of committee with five councilmembers voting in favor and nine opposed. And I am happy to move the legislation.

Speaker 2: Council President Juarez. I Ididn't favor none of those.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Before we move on to a chairman and other businesses, I have a few comments I want to make that I had been hoping that I would not have to make at this point, but apparently it looks like I. Moving forward as a point of order, this council president will have an exercise and hopefully you will all recognize my quote unquote, my virtual gavel that it will mute us. I am going to rely on our colleagues to abide by all rules, hold us accountable to rules, behavior, and courtesy of decorum, civility and basic kindness. The members are reminded that it is never in order to make personal remarks or attacks. The members are reminded that colleagues will not attack or question the integrity or motives of other colleagues. And the members are reminded that we will not be discourteous to each other or make personal and insulting remarks. I'm hoping that going forward as council president, that we instill a safe place, a kind place, so the rest of the city can see that we are a functioning council. They can agree to, agree to disagree and still move forward for this great city. Again, I will use the point of order and I will mute us if indeed this Council President feels that we are not following those basic rules of decency and debate to our colleagues. So with that colleagues, this concludes our items of business today. Our next regularly scheduled city council meeting is on February 15th two, and I hope you all have a great afternoon. Thank you, Madam President. Yes.
Speaker 5: Sorry. I did have a good of the order item. I apologize. But just briefly, I would like to ask to be excused from the March 20 seconds and 29 Council meetings.
Speaker 0: Tuesday to Thursday Senate March due to Tuesdays to Tuesdays. Okay. Well, let's do this then. Well, I do not have my script here, so I'm just going to have to do it from memory. It seems that Council member Lewis would like to be excused. Are there any is there any opposition or concerns or comments that you would like to share with Mr. Lewis on why he cannot be excused on those two Tuesdays? Hearing or seeing none. You were indeed excused. Mr. Lewis.
Speaker 5: Thank you, Madam President. Sorry for just jumping in there.
Speaker 0: That's right. It's. That's how I like it. Just jump right on in. Let me know. I have no problem being told when I'm wrong. Thank you."

Speaker 2: International Fire Code by reference as.
Speaker 0: The Seattle Fire Code, the committee recommends the bill pass. Councilmember Herbold is chair of the committee. You are recognized to provide the committee's report.
Speaker 4: Q So as described this morning in council briefings, the fire code is typically updated along with the Seattle building code. The Seattle building code was passed earlier this month through Councilmember Strauss's leadership and through his committee. We work to pass a fire code in conjunction with the building code to ensure consistency in development standards. The fire code was last updated in 2016 and it's usually updated every three years. Last year, both the building code and the fire code updates were delayed due to the public health emergency. Just highlighting the major changes in the fire code. There are four sort of categories of major, major changes. One relates to our allowing alternative fuel vehicles on display inside buildings to maintain their battery connection in order to keep their safety systems active. A second change relates to the need for integrated testing systems in high rise buildings to assure fire protection and life safety systems work together in an integrated way as intended and are tested at least every ten years. Third relates to a need for mobile fueling of vehicles to allow allow for mobile fueling of vehicles in designated areas such as parking lots and only those parking lots that meet certain requirements. And then finally, there's a new chapter added to address the installation of large electrical and storage systems that are more prevalent now than they were and were unregulated by the previous fire code. I if it's okay now. Madam President, I do have an amendment.
Speaker 0: Absolutely. Please go ahead and address your amendment.
Speaker 4: Thank you. I move to amend the bill 11 9996 attachment eight as present on Amendment one on the agenda.
Speaker 0: Okay. Is there a second?
Speaker 3: Second.
Speaker 0: Thank you so much. It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment one. Councilmember Herbold, I will hand it back over to you so you can address the amendment.

DenverCityCouncil_03212022_22-0159,"Speaker 1: 11 Eyes. Council Resolution 22, dash 201 has been adopted. Madam Secretary, please put the next item up on our screens. Councilmember Flynn, go ahead with your comments on resolution 159, please.
Speaker 4: Thank you, Madam President. I don't want anybody up here on the dais to faint when I say that I am going to vote yes on a contract that includes red light cameras that do not work because they also contain the renewal of our photo radar speeding van program, which I think is essential for safety in our neighborhoods . I think it's disappointing that the agencies have combined the two because, well, just last week we were in a meeting with Dotti and some people from Harvey Park about improvements on Yale Avenue between federal between Irving and Sheridan. And one of the members of the public remarked that the traffic signals along there, the other three at Irving, Lowell and Raleigh, there seem to be more red light running at the one in Lowell. And so I noted for everybody present that that's because the yellow time at the one on.
Speaker 0: Lowell.
Speaker 4: Is inconsistent with the other two. That's why you don't see red light running at the other two as much as you do at the one at Raleigh. So I think it's disappointing that the city agencies seem intent on perpetuating red light running when we know there's a way to effectively eliminate all but intentional and distracted driving cases of red light running, leaving in place dangerous situations where we've identified intersections with a high level of red light running, leaving in place the traffic engineering shortcoming that induces red light running, which is necessary to make red light cameras profitable. I think borderlines on on negligence when there are accidents. We know. For instance, in California, where the state legislature adopted requirements for cities that use cameras to follow a certain formula for setting the yellow change interval, the timing of the yellow light. We know that cities up and down the state have removed their cameras because they no longer had significant red light running. And I mentioned when we when we postponed these contracts about a year or so ago, the case of Loma Linda, California, where one intersection averaged about 250 violations a month, that one approach on one of their streets and Loma Linda, 250 a month. And when they added a little bit of yellow time to the two, the traffic signal violations went down to six per month. And as I said a year ago, how many folks would like to stand at an intersection in Denver and not see anything but one violation every five days at a at a red light? But the agencies seem intent on on combining and packaging the red light cameras with the what I believe is the the positive nature of this contract, which is the photo radar speeding than we are needlessly fining drivers who are caught in our own engineering deficiencies that we are refusing to adequately fix. Since 2008, when this program started, all four of our camera intersections better enforced. And I think this is this is one of the reasons I'm voting for it, by the way, because this new contract will allow us to remove the cameras from those locations and move them around. But they've been at the same four locations ever since 2008. And all of those are on corridors that serve our underserved and marginalized neighborhoods. Three of the four primarily impact commuters from the West Side, including my district. When they come in on Sixth Avenue and go up Lincoln and they return home on Eighth Avenue through Speer. Three times a day, commuters from my area who work downtown go through these. And then the last one, the fourth one is up in on Northeast Park Hill and Central Park, borderline on Quebec, also both with all these locations. Affecting those neighborhoods. But otherwise, people who might live in southeast Denver or South Denver or central Denver, they might not even know we have red light cameras in them because they don't have the opportunity to go through them. When you look at the data that was provided to me by the department, police department. There has been since we instituted this program. There's been a 92% increase in red light running through violations from 2014 through last year. 92%. The data on accidents is also on crashes is also very ambivalent because there's such a short dataset from before we started the program in 2008. There's very little data just two or three years, and you can see that the number of T-Bone accidents from year to year might be the same as they were before the red light cameras went in. I think it's an abject failure when we know. From the California experience. That setting the yellow time properly and appropriately for the traffic conditions virtually eliminates red light running. As I said, the only saving grace is that will be able to, for me in this contract is that we'll be able to finally move them from sixth in Kalamazoo and from eighth and Speer and sixth and Lincoln and 36 and Quebec and put to put them in some other parts of town for a change. Instead of draining the wallets of drivers who otherwise are driving safely but are caught in our engineering shortcomings. Thank you, Madam President.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And see no other speakers in the queue. We'll go ahead and move. Move forward on the agenda. Madam Secretary, would you please put the next item up on our screens? Councilmember Clark, will you please put Bill 328 on the floor for publication?"
DenverCityCouncil_08292016_16-0553,"Speaker 1: All right. We're moving right along here. And last but not least, let's get let's get bills to find a reduction. 553. Great. Councilwoman Kenny had a question. Okay, good or no?
Speaker 10: I'm sorry. A comment. I correct myself. No vote, though. No vote. Thank you, Mr. President. So 553 this is actually a measure we are referring to the ballot. So for the hundreds of thousands of viewers at home, I thought it was important that we tell you why. We're sending you a question about the Denver preschool program to the ballot. You may remember that you voted last year to approve the Denver preschool tax for another decade, I believe. But what we do in our elections for sales taxes is we try to predict how much money the city is going to get, both from the tax and overall as a city. So we can tell the voters, according to TABOR. And in this case, we I think I'm looking at David, I think we got it right on the sales tax amount, but we were a little low in what the city would take in overall. And so what that means is we need your permission again, because we told you what we thought we were going to take in. We hope that you will tell us again that we should keep the money that we collected for the preschool and use it to get kids head start in life and get them learning their ABCs and safe and quality child care during their start before school. But this will be a vote tonight in our block vote. It appears to send this to you as voters. And so just wanted to make sure folks knew why. And we will need your support to make sure that preschool money keeps in the budget.
Speaker 1: Thank you. You know what? Thank you so much, Councilman Kennedy, for for bringing that up. And we know that kids get a start in preschool, gives them a head start in first and second grade. And so that is data that is proof. So thank you so much for that. Okay. All other bills for introduction are order published. We're ready for the block votes. Councilman Herndon, will you please put the resolution on the floor for adoption?
Speaker 3: Certainly will. Mr. President, I move that the following resolutions be adopted in a block off series of 2016 601607 372 591 598 604 611 593 595 596.

AlamedaCC_09192017_2017-4642,"Speaker 0: So all those in favor. I think that motion carries that was three a an hour here in regards to three B, which is the recommendation to accept the investment report for the quarter ending June 30th, 2017.
Speaker 1: And Kevin Kennedy is here. Can talk about it. And Elena Adair. Okay.
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You're better than at the moment.
Speaker 0: So thank you for being here this evening.
Speaker 2: Of course. Thank, Alina. My name's Kevin Kennedy. I'm the city treasurer. Madame Mayor. Happy belated birthday. Thank you. City Council. Just to give you a quick update on Wells Fargo, as the report indicates, we did sell the positions that we had in Wells Fargo as of June 30th. So the portfolio does not hold. Any Wells Fargo securities in it, which was the the direction we got from counsel. Last spring.
Speaker 0: And can you clarify, was there any loss to the city for doing that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you'll see. On page two of the report, uh, it lists out three bonds that we sold to them. We sold it at a small gain. One, we sold at a loss. Net net, it was about a $2,000 loss, which sounds like a lot of money, but it was a million and a half dollars worth of bonds . So if you take it as a percentage, I think it's about a 10th of a percent. So it wasn't it wasn't a big financial event for the portfolio at all. But it does divest us from from the Wells Fargo investments.
Speaker 0: And then, has that money been reinvested?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes. And Wells Fargo is on the you should call it the no buy list and until further indication. So our managers are aware of that.
Speaker 0: And do you believe that you're able to find comparable investments so that the long term will not be a financial loss to the city to have done that?
Speaker 2: Yeah. You know, the value that they sold at is a factor of interest rates. So, you know, in theory, the interest rates were a little bit higher than when they bought the bonds. So they probably turned around and bought another bond with the interest rates high. I don't think that's a big issue and it's just one issue. Granted, as we've talked about, the the universe of bonds that we can invest in because of our strict credit rating requirements and stuff is fairly limited. But taking one issue or out of that mix probably doesn't affect the portfolio in the long run.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Any other questions from vice mayor?
Speaker 4: It's not really a question. I just wanted to say thank you to both you and Elena for your work on this. And, you know, I think that it's tremendous that not only did we say we were going to do something, but we've actually taken action and we did it in a way that was fiscally savvy for our city. So thank you.
Speaker 0: Absolutely. And I want to also echo that it was commending our council for moving forward on this item. I think it was important. Yes, I believe it was a referral, yes. From vice mayor and member already. Yes. So thank you. All right. So thank you very much. And now do we have a motion to accept three?
Speaker 4: I'll make the motion to accept a3p second.
Speaker 0: All those in favor I motion carries unanimously. Thank you. I will now adjourn this special FCIC meeting and we will now open the regular city council meeting.

AlamedaCC_04042017_2017-4092,"Speaker 2: We do. And it is. I is recommendation to approve the amended and restated maintenance and cost sharing agreement between the City of Alameda and Alameda West Lagoon Homeowners Association.
Speaker 3: It.
Speaker 0: All right, Steph, do you want to maybe just introduce this item? But someone introduced this item before. That's a5e.
Speaker 3: Uh huh. Yeah.
Speaker 5: Good afternoon, Madam Mirror. Members of the City Council. Members of the audience. My name is Enrico Pinnick. I'm the assistant city of assistant city attorney for the city of Alameda. Normally, staff would present this item, but I worked on it and I think I can answer your questions just by way of general background. This is an agreement that basically brings up to date an existing relationship that we've had with the Lagoon Housing, the Lagoon Homeowners Association, as you may know, and I'm sorry, I'm speaking somewhat generally. I didn't I wasn't quite prepared to.
Speaker 0: Write this item just to give us a little bit of information. So we knew.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 5: As, as, you know, the the the guns are manmade. And also, although they serve a recreational purpose for the homeowners that surround the lagoon, they also provide a public utility in the sense that we use the lagoons to help capture stormwater and then meter it out into the bay. This agreement is a maintenance agreement, and it basically sets forth the relationship between the city and the homeowner's association as it relates to certain maintenance obligations for the use of the lagoons for that public purpose. This relationship has been ongoing for a long period of time, and the old relationship, the old agreement expired. And what we were trying to do through this amended and restated agreement today was to, one, bring the agreement up to certain city standards as it relates to insurance and indemnification. And also to clarify some things that we have been we being the city and the homeowner's association have been doing as a matter of practice, but hadn't actually been addressed in the contract with that is sort of an overview that would conclude my presentation and I'd be happy to answer any questions that you have.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Well, we have a public speaker, so I just going to go ahead and call the speaker, if that's all right. I appreciate that. Okay. Karen Butcher.
Speaker 4: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Vice Mayor, council members, staff and ladies and gentlemen, Karen Bootle here and I am the Secretary of the Alameda West Lagoon Homeowners Association. And I wanted to come here and in particular, and I apologize to Mr. Penick for not warning him, but in particular to thank the city and the city staff for working with us to update and restate this agreement. The agreement was originally signed in 1964. So the homeowners association and we are a volunteer board and the city in particular public works and occasionally members of your your city attorney's office have been working together for over half a century. This is a public and private partnership. And there's so much talk these days about public and private partnership. I just wanted to stand up and say, hey, we got one, it's working and we hope to make it continue to work. So once again, we really appreciate the relationship we have, in particular with our city works, the engineering department, the maintenance folks, and I hope that continues.
Speaker 0: Thank you very much. I appreciate you coming on and sharing that. We've been working together since 1964 on this. It's wonderful.
Speaker 3: Those were built.
Speaker 0: Thank you for adding that. So the lagoons were built in 57. For those of you that didn't hear her.
Speaker 7: We do like emotional.
Speaker 0: Remember?
Speaker 5: I had a quick comment. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you, Karen, for coming. You and I had a little conversation about this at the League of Women Voters. Meet your elected officials last week. And what I wanted to add that that Karen didn't add was that they do have a homeowners association and they are looking for volunteers . They have two open spots. So if you are on lagoons 3 to 5, they would really like to have you apply because most of the people come from lagoons one and two. So check with Karen if you're interested or if you're out in the audience. I served on homeowners boards and I think it's a really rewarding experience. And I'm glad that this that this agreement, which is older than me, is finally updating. I'd like to move approval.
Speaker 7: And I'll second.
Speaker 0: Others in favor. I am curious unanimously. Thank you very much. Okay. And now we get to six a.
Speaker 2: Recommendation to approve an implementation term sheet with Mid-Penn Housing LME 2.0, Collaborative Building Futures with Women and Children and Operation Dignity for the relocation and construction of new supportive housing facilities on a 10.4 acre parcel in the Main Street neighborhood of Alameda Point."
AlamedaCC_11172015_2015-2270,"Speaker 1: Considered directing staff to provide the city council with a report on the feasibility of including Alameda in the service area or the Bay Area Bike Share Program. This referral came from Councilmember Ody and Brody.
Speaker 5: Thank you for being at such a late hour. I'll try to be brief so we can get out of here. So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco , San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that. I know the MBC was looking to expand it to other cities and I would just like to get the sense of the council to instruct staff that if MTC is still looking to expand this or if they're looking to expand this in the future, you know that Alameda make an effort to participate because I think we really are of all of the cities in the Bay Area the most bikeable and you know bike sharing for those that don't know it like city car share where you can pick up a car, you know, take it somewhere and drop it off. Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later. So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.
Speaker 0: Member Ashcraft.
Speaker 4: I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it. I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city. We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders. But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.
Speaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.
Speaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.
Speaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too. So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.
Speaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.
Speaker 5: Thank you.
Speaker 0: Member de SAC.
Speaker 6: Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several. Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.
Speaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda. Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.
Speaker 0: That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right. We're going to move on then.
Speaker 6: I mean.
Speaker 0: You had direction with that.
Speaker 4: There's consensus."
AlamedaCC_02172015_2015-1189,"Speaker 0: Recommendation to accept the quarterly sales tax report for the period ending December 31st, 2014, collected during the period to July 1st, 2014 to September 30th, 2014.
Speaker 5: Good evening, Madame Mayor and Council Members. Please be gentle. This first time I've been here talking about this. Introduce yourself. Oh, I'm sorry. My name is Brad Farmer, and I'm in the finance department. The city here. We're looking currently at the second quarter collections for sales tax that actually were sold and collected in the first quarter for last year. So just to remind you, I know two weeks ago you were reminded that there was a lag period of 90 days. This is the second one that we received. One of the nice parts about this current one is that we're at 40%. Compared to last year, we were at 32%. So we're a little bit ahead. One of the questions that did arise last time was there was a $313,000 one time adjustment. The entities that were adjusted to actually are on our normal tax roll. So that will continue to come forward. Second side you're seeing there is the best part is for the last 13 quarters were up 28%. And it seems to be a pretty solid trend line.
Speaker 0: Okay. Okay. But.
Speaker 5: In the. Trends that we see, we basically see strong sales pretty much across the board in the top 25 are really strong and top 100 continue to be very aggressive. Business and industry continue to lead the way. Order by restaurants in general. Consumer goods. Probably the biggest thing that we're going to have coming, I think, is going to be the online retail sales, which are going to come from the county pool. That seems to be the fastest growing area is me. Unless we can get more retailers in here and this is going to continue to probably be our fastest growing pool. This graph here shows you basically the industries. And as I said, business and industry restaurants and consumer goods tend to be really strong. The one concern that I would have if there's anything is going to be on fuel and as you noticed, the prices, I think when we were here last time, we're down about $0.25. Tesoro just had a strike, so prices jumped again, $0.30 in the last two weeks. And that all depends on what happens in the fracking industry and as the prices go up and down per barrel. But I think this is where we're going to see some loss in the next year, probably as well as HTL, who handles all of our sales tax. They also suggested that this might be the case. And then once again, we are still at the bottom of the chart as far as sales tax goes. The countywide tax, or this was another question that came up last time was 9%. In San Leandro, it's 9.25. Albany is 9.5 and else redo is 9.5. Those are all special taxes that their council along the voters represented and passed to get on to their ballots. We don't currently have that. Any questions?
Speaker 1: Thank you. Council members. Any questions? May we have a motion move?
Speaker 3: Approval of the staff report and recommendation.
Speaker 4: Second.
Speaker 1: All those in favor.

Speaker 4: Thank you. Council President. One thing that I just wanted to highlight from the hearing, something that the administration brought out regarding docket number 0537. Because I know that this is something that a lot of folks particularly brought in. I know it's an issue that we'll talk about. Continue to talk about. But a lot of the support that the city has received from HUD over the past years have really flatlined, especially in in when we think about inflation. And so there is a potential challenge to the census which undercounted a lot of our populations. And we have but I transient populations are immigrants and that challenge could result in us getting more resources into these HUD block grants that we receive. So just something for the Council to explore because I know that something that others have elevated and that's something I've expressed concern about too, and how it affects how much money, how much we receive in these important block grants that not only help with housing, but also economic development and small business development as well. So thank you.
