LongBeachCC_11202018_18-1021,"Speaker 0: Thank you very much. That concludes public comment. We're going on to Iowa. We have the hearing and the Long Beach Airport noise ordinance next to items. So, Madam Clerk, the hearing, please.
Speaker 1: Hearing item one is a report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing and adopt resolution. Amending the master fee and charges schedule citywide.
Speaker 0: Mr. West, who's who's doing this?
Speaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Staff report will be given by Linda Tatum.
Speaker 2: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the Council. This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing. That concludes the presentation. But I'm here as well as Lisa Falls, our Administrative Services Bureau manager, who assisted on this project. And we can respond to any questions you have.
Speaker 0: Thank you. I got a motion in a second. Let me just do is there any public comment first seen a public comment? Councilor Pearce.
Speaker 6: I just want to say great job staff are really tackling how to reduce those costs in a creative way. Thank you for your hard work.
Speaker 0: So Mango.
Speaker 6: I completely concur. Well-written agenda item. I appreciate the work that was done and I think this is a good solution. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you, members. Please cast your votes.
Speaker 1: Motion carries.
Speaker 0: Great. Thank you very much. Next up is item 17."
LongBeachCC_09042018_18-0783,"Speaker 1: Motion carries.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Item 22.
Speaker 1: Report from City Manager. Recommendation to Request City Attorney to prepare a resolution to oppose Proposition six. The voter approval for future gas and vehicle taxes and 2017 tax repeal initiative citywide.
Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.
Speaker 2: Yes. Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one. So I would strongly suggest let's just so strongly support the city council opposing measure. I mean, Proposition six.
Speaker 0: Becky, there's a motion and a second seconded by Councilman Austin. Councilman Austin.
Speaker 8: Yes. I'd also like to just weigh in and say, I think it's important for us to to stand by what we've worked for as a council and support it for for several years. It was the Fix Our Roads kind of campaign through the League of California Cities, a lot of our legislative advocacy for infrastructure support and dollars for state highways, but also for local roads as well, that this these dollars actually will go a long way, if I'm not mistaken. Stephanie, can you tell me specifically how much if SB six does pass, how much we would stand to lose as a city?
Speaker 2: Diana Chang.
Speaker 1: Good morning, Mayor.
Speaker 5: And Members of the City Council. SB 145 19 We've budgeted $8 million for.
Speaker 1: Projects in all nine council districts, and so those revenues would would likely.
Speaker 7: Be.
Speaker 5: Repealed and, and the projects would be without.
Speaker 1: A source of dedicated funding.
Speaker 8: So that's that's $8 million annually, correct?
Speaker 1: It's $8 million for FY 19.
Speaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.
Speaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.
Speaker 3: Streets and.
Speaker 1: Roads.
Speaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.
Speaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.
Speaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents. And so for those reasons, I support this this motion to support to support or oppose. SB I'm to be very clear to oppose SB six.
Speaker 0: Six and let me add one thing that wasn't, I think unless I missed it in Dana Takes presentation, which is that the SB one not just not only includes all the street work and the annual funding that comes in, but they're also doing specific, larger streets. And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach. And so that is a project that the state's doing that's in Long Beach that doesn't count towards our our amount. And so that that's a huge project that is obviously incredibly, incredibly expensive. And so that's why work goes through most of the city. There's a motion of seconds are public comment on this item saying none please cast your votes."
LongBeachCC_03202018_18-0269,"Speaker 4: Motion carries. Thank you very much. Thank you. And we will. We're going to go ahead and move on to item 12, please. Just the next item on the agenda.
Speaker 0: Item two, I was communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Spano, Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Turanga. Recommendation to require a city manager to develop a free voluntary bike registration program by partnering with Project 5 to 9.
Speaker 4: Thank you. I can have everyone just say we're going to keep moving the agenda as we exit. So please. Councilwoman Price.
Speaker 6: I'm not. Is there anyone left from public works that might be able to.
Speaker 1: Speak about this?
Speaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.
Speaker 1: This is a quick one.
Speaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.
Speaker 1: The.
Speaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.
Speaker 1: Will give.
Speaker 9: The police.
Speaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.
Speaker 1: Bike theft problem head.
Speaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.
Speaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments. I ask my colleagues to support us. This is, in my opinion, as as our city manager often says, motherhood and apple pie. Thank you.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Councilmember Supernormal.
Speaker 4: I support.
Speaker 3: This item.
Speaker 4: Wholeheartedly.
Speaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Andrew.
Speaker 11: Yes. And I want to thank Councilman Price for bringing this item, you know, to the diary, because the free bicycle registration program, I think it's a step in the right direction because we always kind of brag about our Long Beach bike friendly city. But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes. So I'm excited about seeing this progress in program, you know, coming to action. Thank you, Councilman Price.
Speaker 3: Thank you. Any public comment on this item saying no members, please cast your vote.
Speaker 0: Councilmember Ranga. Motion carries."
LongBeachCC_05062014_14-0330,"Speaker 0: Item 12 item calls a recommendation to adopt plans and specifications for the Naples Island permanent seawall repairs.
Speaker 1: So moved a motion and a second. Any public comment on the item? Mr. Goodhue.
Speaker 4: An up.
Speaker 9: Very good. You click as the address. I support the concept in chief and I've studied the plan for doing it and moving forward in this first phase.
Speaker 0: And I think it makes it eminent sense.
Speaker 9: And I think also the mitigation plan for this first section makes sense. I'm not sure about the mitigation for the balance of the program, but at least for this sense that makes and for this first phase, it makes sense where the problem comes up. Excuse me.
Speaker 4: 1/2 and. Where the problem.
Speaker 9: Surfaces is in the the funding of it. And I support using tidelands funds. But I think the city is going to find itself in a position of not being able to use those tidelands funds pending the given the specter of the pending indictment and arrest the Vice mayor. Commissioner. Coastal Commissioner Garcia. There are some details handed out here relative to that, and next week I'll go further into it. But I think the city needs to examine methods of financing at it other than the Tidelands Agency, because I think the requisite authorities that have the ability to do so are going to put the foot on the neck until they clean up the corruption that is set forth in not only here, but this comes on the heels, of course, as you know, the chief counsel for the Department of Boating Waterways caught the city trying to illegally use money to benefit friends of Bob Foster in the Long Beach Yacht Club. That does not instill confidence. So I think it's foolish to move forward counting on the Tidelands funds until they get a master in here to clean up the shop. I think they've come to realize now that the potential dollars that we're talking about here are approaches, approaches that which has resulted in the increase in the incarceration of the people in Bell. The instant issue here that brings it into focus is to S and the Marine stadium that was put forward that saying it was an epicenter of crime. The police reports clearly that are in your hands now showing that there's no crime. The building is secured at night with iron curtains, £200 each. All of both of which are chained with chain and steel at night. There is no crime. It was a ruse to make a gift to $300,000 to a few select people. That is going to hold up, I believe, the use of tidelands funds. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Vice Chair Councilors if I can, to point out as a city manager, we have no idea what.
Speaker 2: Mr. Good he is talking about. Any of the allegations just made are just made up. We have no idea. We never heard about this. So I just want to make that very, very clear that we have no idea what he's talking about.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Break the chains.
Speaker 6: Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Maureen, for all your work and the other public comments. Sea none believe there's a motion on the floor for item 12. Please go and cast your votes.

Speaker 3: And second. In any member, the public would just council item 11 say none. But it's good you.
Speaker 2: Larry GOODHEW Clarke as he addressed the four related items here. And I'm certainly not going to speak on each one of them, but I would take I want to take 3 minutes, but just and combine it all. But I do want to take if you'll allow me about 40 seconds to follow up and a relative to that great deal, the the the newest millionaire. And there's something very sweet about it. Remember, the guys came to they came to this country with $0 and were really poverty. They were living on food stamps. The mother had severe cancer and so forth. Fast forward to today that they signed it. Zuckerberg had the guy over to his house for lunch and they had been working on the deal for a few months into that, running up for that. They decided to sign the deal and they picked up the phone and they called their respective legal teams and said, meet us over here, will sign the paperwork. And the guy said, Listen, I've got a better place to sign that. And Zuckerberg said, Fine, here we go. They hopped in the car, went about 20, 20 minutes, 20 miles away, and it was a vacant building. And that was the only obstacle.
Speaker 3: Is there any relevance to.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's just a sweet thing to keep in mind. All of the vacant buildings, the Social Security office where he used to get food stamps and like Martin Luther King, he took the contract that that sealed the deal, signed it to the grill and the door and signed it. So that it's just a sweet thing on this. I'm going to make this suggestion. If the city clerk and the city attorney can fashion what I'm about to say into something that is acceptable. Now I know the state the city declares a state of emergency many times. I'm going to suggest that the city, this council. After listening to the city fashioning and having the city attorney examine it together with the clerk. Declare a state of emergency. Postpone. The election for one year, during which time the city will hire a retired US federal judge. Obviously not from the ninth Circuit. To help bring this, we put the city back on a sound footing. And a year from now. Go back to the public. And that's based upon the fact that every day I hear from more and more people and. Both sides of the aisle. The overwhelming sentiment is the two choices we have in terms of the mayoral election, and that's all I'm talking about, the mayoral election. The two choices are simply putrid, period. And I find it astonishing. That within what was once a great city, we can't find two people again.
Speaker 0: Regardless of what side of the aisle we got.
Speaker 3: It was a good year. Time's expired. Thank you. I think we know your sentiments on this.

Speaker 4: This is a report from the city manager with the recommendation to authorize the city manager execute documents with Global Green for professional technical assistance to conduct a sustainable neighborhood assessment for the historic Virginia Village Market Street Neighborhood District eight.
Speaker 3: Straws.
Speaker 5: Yes, Mr. Mayor, thank you very much. I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public. This is a endeavor that is very important to North Lawn Beach communities, particularly those neighborhoods surrounding the Market Avenue corridor. I wanted to let staff report exactly on what this Global Green Initiative is actually all about. And so I turn it over to the city manager.
Speaker 8: Mayor. Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.
Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well. And so Market Street is a is a is a priority for this. My office and you can count on my full participation in my office is full participation in this assessment process can make it successful. Thank you very much for your hard work.

Authorizing the execution of a collective bargaining agreement between the City of Seattle and Public Service and Industrial Employees. Local 1239 and ratifying confirming certain prior acts Council Bill 118 646 relating to city employment. Authorizing the execution of a collective bargaining agreement between the city CEO and Teamsters Local Union Number 117 and ratifying confirming certain prior acts council bill 118 644 relating to city employment. Authorizing the execution of a collective bargaining agreement between the City of Seattle and Washington State Council of County and City Employees AFSCME Local 21 and ratifying confirming certain prior acts. All bills introduced March 21st, 2016.
Speaker 0: Thank you very much. So all three of these bills are basically giving the mayor the authority to implement a collective bargaining agreement between three different union bodies. All three of these agreements were established within the parameters established by the Seattle councils, the City Council's Labor Relations Committee. So the first one is an agreement between the public service and industrial employees. Local 1239. That agreement will last till the end of December 2018. And I should probably should have said that I am filling in for Councilmember Burgess in his absence on this legislation. That particular agreement with one, two, three nine affects up to 125 regular sitting employees and up to 225 active temporary employees. The second counts, Bill 118646 is between the city and the Teamsters local union. 117 And I think all of you are familiar with 117 and the agreement affects up to 15 regular city employees and up to 200 active temporary employees. Again, that agreement will last through the end of 12th December 2018. In the last bill, 118644 is between the city and the Washington State Council of County and City Employees f. S CME Local 21. And that agreement again last to the end of December 2018, and that affects up to 150 regular city employees. And contrary to some of the public testimony that you heard today, we believe that these these agreements are acceptable to the employees, that their ability to to unionize and be a strong member of their respective unions strengthens our entire city and is for the benefit of our workers who mean the most to us. And so the certainly we recommend approval of these three agreements, which are all consistent with the parameters set by the Council's Labor Relations Committee. I move to pass in Lester.

Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on. The commission will be comprised of 15 members, six appointed by the mayor, six appointed by the city council, two appointed by the commission and the final member young adult appointed through the Get Engaged program, which is a city YMCA program. The Commission will be staffed through the Department of Neighborhoods and assuming this passes and the mayor signs it, which I believe he will, outreach about the commission and applications for individuals who would like to be appointed to the commission will begin in April. We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters. And so if this commission can help bridge that relationship, then that'll be a positive move for our city. So council members Herbold, O'Brien and Suarez have joined me in sponsoring this legislation and we urge its adoption.
Speaker 0: Thank you very much for the comments, COUNCILMEMBER. Whereas.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Before I begin, I do want to have a special thank you to Zack DeWolf for his leadership and boldness, not only for the residents of Capitol Hill and the community and all the all the projects that he works on, but also taking on a big project for all the residents of Seattle. Again, as we say in Indian Country, my hands are up to you. Thank you. I just want to point out that the demographics of our city have changed a lot over the years. I think it's important to note. In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions. I was grateful to co-sponsor this legislation and I'm happy to vote in favor of today. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you. Because member o'brien.
Speaker 3: Councilmember suarez said everything i was going to say much more elegantly. But thank you all so much for your advocacy.

Speaker 3: Good evening, board members. Michael Carey again from the Department of Finance Special District Team. I am before you tonight to give the staff report and request approval for the Gateway Village General Improvement District 2017 Annual Work Plan and Budget. The district is located in the northeastern section of the city, northwest of the intersection of I-70 and Chambers Road that consists of approximately 243 acres on the eastern border of Montebello. It is completely developed and primarily consists of residential property. Responsibilities include maintaining the landscaping and parks within the District. City Council. Approve the formation of the Gateway Village General Improvement District by ordinance number 551 series 1994 and establish City Council as the ex-officio board of Directors of the District. The ordinance also created the District Advisory Board made up of property owners within the guide. The ordinance specified that such property owners are sorry. The ordinance specify that such advisory board should conduct Dimanche, conduct and manage all affairs of the district as the authorized agent of the Board of Directors, including its financial and legal affairs. Pursuant to Resolution Number 32 Series 1995, Denver City Council authorized the District's advisory board to create a work plan and budget for approval by the Board of Directors annually. The Gateway Village Guide 2017 Budget proposes overall expenditures of $315,000 and total revenues of $484,022. Most of the district's revenue will be generated by a 20 mill levy assessed on real property in the district, which is a 5.7 mil reduction from last year's budget. The major difference between the 16 and 17 budget is that the district will make its final debt payment on December 1st of this year and will no longer have any outstanding debt beginning in 2017. The District intends to create a capital to create a fund to to fund capital projects for 2017. In order to provide a reserve analysis, hire a landscape designer and undertake landscape improvements and tree replacements. City staff has reviewed the 2017 Budget Work Plan and recommends it for approval. Jeffrey Erbe of Center and Vandewalle, legal counsel for the District, is also here and available to answer any questions. Thank you.

AlamedaCC_07202021_2021-1128,"Speaker 1: Five eyes. Okay. Thank you. And so that was a special city council meeting that we needed to take to dispense those items. I'm sorry, Councilmember Desai.
Speaker 3: For still on three. I'd like to do council communications.
Speaker 0: Sure.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 3: Thank you. I'll make this quick as possible. Thank you.
Speaker 2: Very much. I just want to enter into the record the names of eight great young men who did a variety of community services towards earning their eagle Eagle Scout honor. And I just want to say that on June 26, on behalf of mayor, as he Ashcraft, I attended the Eagle Court of Honor that was held in the afternoon, Saturday afternoon.
Speaker 3: At Franklin.
Speaker 2: Park, where eight young Alameda INS were given. They had earned the Eagle rank. As a result, a variety of of community activities. I just wanted.
Speaker 3: For the record to enter their names.
Speaker 2: In and I hope that we make a practice of this.
Speaker 3: Going forward.
Speaker 2: These eight individuals are Henry Bank. Terry Banchory. Brendan Cook. Jonathan Hill dress. Andrew Jurek and his brother Eric Jurek, Zachary Quayle, Tibor Thompson and Vander von Stroheim. All of these individuals had to do a minimum of 25 community activities. And one of them, Jonathan Hildreth, did as much as I think it was, 45. So they did a lot of great things on behalf of the community in earning their Eagle Scout badge. And I believe our mayor has some experience in dealing with Eagle Scouts.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember de. And I really did appreciate you attending that Eagle Code of honor. I loved to attend them, but I just had a conference and couldn't be there. And it is really special. And yes, my son Cole is an Eagle Scout from Troop 89. But and I think, if I recall correctly from the emails, some of these young men would have gotten this award last year, but it was in the midst of COVID and so they couldn't meet. So it was kind of a combined combined group, but all really hardworking individuals and and I really appreciate you attending for me and I know you enjoyed it. Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 2: If I could just say one more quick thing. And that was Boy Scout Troop.
Speaker 3: 73 in Alameda.
Speaker 1: Thank you so much. Thank you. Councilmember Harris, Spencer James, for your handout. Yes.
Speaker 0: I I'd like to share that this Saturday, the 24th from 6 to 10 p.m. is Relay for Life at.
Speaker 1: Lydecker.
Speaker 0: Park. And they didn't have it last year, as far as I know. So for those of you that are supportive, it's because cancer doesn't sleep, that they do it annually as a reminder and just support those with cancer and survivors. And as we pass, the second point I wanted to share is I serve on the airport noise forum and they have actually created an app that you can use to report loud noises from planes to make it easier. If you go to the website, fly quiet. Okay. Okay. Dot com and scroll down. You'll see an app that you can load and then it's much easier to report the noise. And then finally, I wanted to share that this live Saturday at Nob Hill, there was the Boy Scout. Nathaniel Basco had come up with his Eagle Scout project, which is a piano for the community to share. It'll be available for three weeks at our side of Nob Hill. Then after that, I think it's going to be moved to a permanent location. And I want to also recognize Deirdre Freeman, the local artist who painted it for the project. So you're all welcome to go out there and play the piano. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. And thank you for reminding the community about Relay for Life this Saturday later carpark. And all right, now we are moving on up, so we are going to adjourn that special meeting. Bear with me audience and we are moving on to continued to the continued July six, 2021 Council meeting."
AlamedaCC_09152020_2020-8293,"Speaker 1: Which is final passage of ordinance amending the element of principle code by amending Chapter 27 development fees by repealing 27 dash for only two point development impact reads in its entirety. And we have a speaker on this item.
Speaker 2: All right, um, our speaker, please.
Speaker 1: Jay Garfinkel.
Speaker 2: Mr. Garfinkle. There you are.
Speaker 3: Hi. Well, I don't have any particular interest in the outcome. I'm more concerned with the process. The item has a letter from an attorney representing a company that has assessed the situation and feels that it. I'm not sure if it's illegal or unwise or whatever, but there is a challenge to the proceeding and it would seem to me that we should hear from the city manager in writing and the city attorney in writing to determine whether there's any validity to the objection that's been filed. Like I said, I don't care how it comes out. I just think that it since a legal challenge is being raised, that we should get response from our city staff . Thank you.
Speaker 2: And I will just say not that this Q&A, but just an observation that this is final passage of an ordinance as a second reading. And this item was before the council at the last council meeting and fully deliberated and voted upon at that time. Do we have any further speakers on this item? Public speakers, Madam Clerk.
Speaker 1: We have none.
Speaker 2: Okay. And then anything further from the council saying then maybe we have a roll.
Speaker 0: Call vote, please.
Speaker 1: Do you have a motion in the Second Amendment?
Speaker 2: I was doing it backwards. We would have gotten around to the immersion in the vice mayor is second from. Councilmember Vela second. Right. Okay.
Speaker 1: Again. Councilmember de fag? Yes. Next light. Hi, Odie.
Speaker 3: Yes.
Speaker 1: Vella. Yes, Mayor. As the Ashcroft I carries by five eyes.
Speaker 2: All right. Thank you very much. So with that, we have concluded the consent calendar, and now we move to the regular calendar, regular agenda.
Speaker 1: Exchange, the adoption of resolutions, reappointing Thomas Saxby as a member of the Historical Advisory Board, reappointing Adam Gillet, and appointing a Tierney stringer as members of the Public Art Commission, reappointing Gerald 70 as a member of the Public Utilities Board, and appointing Samantha Soules as a member of the Transportation Commission.
Speaker 2: And approval he is second. Okay. Do we have any comments? And I just want to comment. I said I think I said this when I introduced these names of these individuals last week, that I am just overwhelmed and so heartened and gratified. And I know council would share my sentiments with the quantity and the quality of applicants we're getting. And I'm talking to our different staff who staffs our different boards and commissions. And we think it's a combination of, you know, it's COVID 19. People are working from home, so maybe they have a little more time to focus on some local issues. But I think with all the layers of issues we've been dealing with since the spring, people have really focused on how can I make a difference? And one of the things I love hearing when I'm interviewing and I always conduct the interviews with whoever the city staff is who staffs that Border Commission. But if people are saying they just want to give back, they love living here, they want to give back. And I'm really excited that we have a combination of folks who've lived here while we've got newcomers, and they all bring so much talent and energy to the to the table. So thank you all and welcome. And so, Madam Clerk, this is where and I see we've got Adam Gillett, who's a graphic artist who is on he's returning. He is the current president of the Public Art Commission. Tierney Ringer is a newcomer, extremely talented women worked for the Smithsonian when she was back in D.C., worked for the Exploratorium. When she came out here, mom of two preschoolers, you know, one of those with lots of free time, but willing to share her time and her"
AlamedaCC_07162019_2019-6992,"Speaker 0: Actually, I was thinking we have a very, very capable, proactive city clerk, Laura Weisinger, and I know you're a strong partner in this. So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair. So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?
Speaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.
Speaker 1: But difficult. I know you don't think congratulations like married.
Speaker 9: There were some issue with ABC which.
Speaker 0: Okay. Next step is oral communications where we have a limited number of speakers may address the counsel regarding any matter not on the agenda and we have 15 minutes set aside for that and any additional public comment that doesn't happen in those 15 minutes will happen later in the agenda. So do we have any speakers?
Speaker 1: We have three.
Speaker 0: Three. So with three speakers you will each get 3 minutes. You never have to feel like you have to use all 3 minutes. But any. Would you want to call our speakers?
Speaker 1: Sure. Pat Potter Mackenzie. Tap and simmer.
Speaker 3: You don't know how tempted I am to continue my conversation on the car, but I won't.
Speaker 0: I'm not on the agenda.
Speaker 3: It's not on me anyway. I just wanted to point out that that the impression I got from that incredibly great city comment meeting at the Elks Lodge about carp was so well attended and the ideas were so fantastic. But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary. And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library."
AlamedaCC_09012015_2015-1940,"Speaker 1: Five F recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for 12 months. Permanent amount not to exceed 300,000.
Speaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.
Speaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.
Speaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?
Speaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.
Speaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.
Speaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.
Speaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.
Speaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.
Speaker 0: And I appreciate that. Thank you for the comments.
Speaker 8: No, I just said I'm willing to move approval because I think Mr. Potter gave an excellent explanation if we want to keep these projects moving. Time is money. This is not impacting our general fund, and I think we're serving our community well. So with that, I will move approval of item five after recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for a 12 month term in an amount not to exceed $300,000.
Speaker 0: We have a second.
Speaker 3: Second. All right.
Speaker 0: Any other comments? All those in favor.
Speaker 3: I think you.
Speaker 0: Of motion passes 4 to 1. Thank you. Thank you. And now we have speakers on five. Q And five are with you.
Speaker 1: And five Q is a final passage of ordinance amending the Alameda Municipal Code by adding article? What does that 14 to Chapter six concerning review of rent increases."
